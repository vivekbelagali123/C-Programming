You are looking at the Epsilon tutorial.

Epsilon commands generally involve the Control key or the Alt key.
This tutorial uses the following conventions:

 Ctrl-<chr>  means hold the Control key (labelled Ctrl) while typing
             the character <chr>.  Thus, Ctrl-F would be: hold the
             Control key and type f.
 Alt-<chr>   means hold the Alt key down while typing <chr>.

Important note: if you must exit at some point, type Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z.

The characters ">>" at the left margin indicate directions for you to
try using a command.  For instance:

>>  Now type Ctrl-V (next-page) to move to the next screenful.
    (go ahead, do it by depressing the control key and V together).
    From now on, you'll be expected to do this whenever you finish
    reading the screen.

Note that there is an overlap when going from screen to screen; this
provides some continuity when moving through the file.

The first thing that you need to know is how to move around from
place to place in the file.  You already know how to move forward a
screen, with Ctrl-V.  To move backwards a screen, type Alt-V (depress
the Alt key and type V).

>>  Try typing Alt-V and then Ctrl-V to move back and forth a
    few times.

If your keyboard has a cursor keypad, you can generally type the
appropriate key there if you prefer.  For example, the synonym for
Ctrl-V is <PageDown>, and that for Alt-V is <PageUp>.


SUMMARY
-------

The following commands are useful for viewing screenfuls:

    Ctrl-V  Move forward one screenful
    Alt-V   Move backward one screenful
    Ctrl-L  Put the text near the cursor at the center.


BASIC CURSOR CONTROL
--------------------

Getting from screenful to screenful is useful, but how do you
reposition yourself within a given screen to a specific place?  There
are several ways you can do this.  One way (not the best, but the
most basic) is to use the commands previous, backward, forward and
next.  As you can imagine these commands (which are given to Epsilon
as Ctrl-P, Ctrl-B, Ctrl-F, and Ctrl-N, respectively, or by the
corresponding arrow key on the numeric keypad) move the cursor from
where it currently is to a new place in the given direction.  Here,
in a more graphical form, are the main keyboard forms of the commands:
 
                          Previous line, Ctrl-P
                                    :
                                    :
   Backward, Ctrl-B .... Current cursor position .... Forward, Ctrl-F
                                    :
                                    :
                            Next line, Ctrl-N

You'll probably find it easy to think of these by letter.  P for
previous, N for next, B for backward and F for forward.  These are
the basic cursor positioning commands and you'll be using them ALL
the time so it would be of great benefit if you learn them now.

>> Do a few Ctrl-N's to bring the cursor down to this line.

>> Move into the line with Ctrl-F's and then up with Ctrl-P's.
   See what Ctrl-P does when the cursor is in the middle of the line.

Under Windows, DOS and OS/2, lines are separated by a pair of
characters, a Return and a Linefeed, but Epsilon almost always makes
them look like one character.  You can think of it as a Newline.

>> Try to Ctrl-B at the beginning of a line.  Do a few more Ctrl-B's.
   Then do Ctrl-F's back to the end of the line and beyond.

>> Use the arrow keys to move to the end of this line [right here -->]
   by going to the beginning of this line and using the left arrow
   key to move backwards onto the end of the previous line.

When you go off the top or bottom of the screen, the text beyond
the edge is shifted onto the screen so that your instructions can
be carried out while keeping the cursor on the screen.

>> Try to move the cursor off the bottom of the screen with Ctrl-N
   and see what happens.

If moving by characters is too slow, you can move by words.  Alt-F
(Alt-F) moves forward a word and Alt-B moves back a word, as do
the cursor pad keys Ctrl-<Right> and Ctrl-<Left>, respectively.

>> Type a few Alt-F's and Alt-B's.  Intersperse them with Ctrl-F's
   and Ctrl-B's.

Notice the parallel between Ctrl-F and Ctrl-B on the one hand, and
Alt-F and Alt-B on the other hand.  Very often Alt characters are
used for operations related to English text whereas Control
characters operate on the basic textual units that are independent of
what you are editing (characters, lines, etc).  There is a similar
parallel between lines and sentences: Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E move to the
beginning or end of a line, and Alt-A and Alt-E move to the beginning
or end of a sentence.

>> Try a couple of Ctrl-A's, and then a couple of Ctrl-E's.
   Try a couple of Alt-A's, and then a couple of Alt-E's.

See how repeated Ctrl-A's do nothing, but repeated Alt-A's keep
moving farther.  Do you think that this is right?

Two other simple cursor motion commands are Alt-< (Alt Less-than),
which moves to the beginning of the file, and Alt-> (Alt
Greater-than), which moves to the end of the file.  You probably
don't need to try them, since finding this spot again will be boring.
Since you need the shift key to type a "<", you must also use the
shift key to type Alt-<.  Otherwise, you would be typing Alt-,.  The
keypad synonyms for these commands are Ctrl-<Home> and Ctrl-<End>.

The location of the cursor in the text is also called "point".  To
paraphrase, the cursor shows on the screen where point is located in
the text.

Here is a summary of simple moving operations including the word and
sentence moving commands:

    Numeric Keypad  Main Keyboard
    <Right>         Ctrl-F  Move forward a character
    <Left>          Ctrl-B  Move backward a character

    Ctrl-<Right>    Alt-F   Move forward a word
    Ctrl-<Left>     Alt-B   Move backward a word

    <Down>          Ctrl-N  Move to next line
    <Up>            Ctrl-P  Move to previous line

    Alt-<Left>      Ctrl-A  Move to beginning of line
    Alt-<Right>     Ctrl-E  Move to end of line

    Ctrl-<Up>       Alt-A   Move back to beginning of sentence
    Ctrl-<Down>     Alt-E   Move forward to end of sentence

    Ctrl-<Home>     Alt-<   Go to beginning of file
    Ctrl-<End>      Alt->   Go to end of file

>> Try all of these commands now a few times for practice.
   Since the last two will take you away from this screen,
   you can come back here with Alt-V's and Ctrl-V's.  These are
   the most often used commands.

Like all other commands in Epsilon, these commands can be given
arguments which cause them to be executed repeatedly.  The way you
give a command a repeat count is by typing Ctrl-U and then the digits
before you type the command.  If you have an Alt key, you can omit
the Ctrl-U if you hold down the Alt key while you type the digits.
This is easier, but we recommend the Ctrl-U method because it works
on any keyboard.

For instance, Ctrl-U 8 Ctrl-F moves forward eight characters.
    
>> Try giving a suitable argument to Ctrl-N or Ctrl-P to come as close
   as you can to this line in one jump.

Sometimes you may want to scroll the screen by less than a full
screenful.  Epsilon has two commands Ctrl-Z and Alt-Z that scroll the
screen, like Ctrl-V and Alt-V, but by only a single line, instead of
a screenful.

>> Try scrolling the screen up repeatedly.  What happens to the
   cursor?


ABORTING COMMANDS
-----------------

If Epsilon gets into an infinite (or simply very long) computation
which you don't want to finish, you can usually stop it safely by
typing Ctrl-G.  You can also use Ctrl-G to discard a numeric argument
or the beginning of a command that you don't want to finish.

>> Type Ctrl-U 100 to make a numeric arg of 100, then type Ctrl-G.
   Now type Ctrl-F.  How many characters does it move?
   If you have typed an <Esc> by mistake, you can get rid of it
   with a Ctrl-G.


INSERTING AND DELETING
----------------------

If you want to type text, just do it.  Characters which you can see,
such as A, 7, *, etc. are taken by Epsilon as text and inserted
immediately.  Type <Enter> (sometimes called <Return>) to insert a
line separator.

You can delete the last character you typed by typing <Backspace>.
More generally, <Backspace> deletes the character immediately before
the current cursor position.

>> Do this now, type a few characters and then delete them
   by typing <Backspace> a few times.  Don't worry about this file
   being changed; you won't affect the master tutorial.  This is just
   a copy of it.

>> Now start typing text until you reach the right margin, and keep
   typing.  When a line of text gets too big for one line on the
   screen, the line of text is "continued" onto a second screen line.
   The mark you see at the right margin indicates a line which has
   been continued.
>> Use <Backspace>'s to delete the text until the line fits on one
   screen line again.  The continuation line goes away.  (By the way,
   normally Epsilon scrolls horizontally across wide lines instead
   of using continuation lines.  You can set up Epsilon to operate
   either way.)

>> Move the cursor to the beginning of a line and type <Backspace>.
   This deletes the line separator before the line and merges the
   line onto the previous line.  The resulting line may be too long
   to fit, in which case it has a continuation line.
>> Type <Enter> to insert the separator again.

Remember that most Epsilon commands can be given a repeat count;  Note
that this includes characters which insert themselves.

>>  Try that now -- type Ctrl-U 8 * and see what happens.

You've now learned the most basic way of typing something in
Epsilon and correcting errors.  You can delete by words or lines
as well.  Here is a summary of the delete operations:

    <Backspace>      delete the character just before the cursor
    Ctrl-D or <Del>  delete the next character after the cursor

    Alt-<Backspace>  kill the word immediately before the cursor
    Alt-D            kill the next word after the cursor

    Ctrl-K           kill from the cursor position to end of line
    Alt-K            kill to the end of the current sentence

Notice that <Backspace> and Ctrl-D vs Alt-<Backspace> and Alt-D
extend the parallel started by Ctrl-F and Alt-F.  Ctrl-K and Alt-K
are like Ctrl-E and Alt-E, sort of, in that lines are opposite
sentences.

Now suppose you kill something, and then you decide that you want to
get it back?  Well, whenever you kill something bigger than a
character, Epsilon saves it for you.  To yank it back, use Ctrl-Y.
Note that you don't have to be in the same place to do Ctrl-Y; this
is a good way to move text around.  Also note that the difference
between "Killing" and "Deleting" something is that "Killed" things
can be yanked back, and "Deleted" things cannot.  Generally, the
commands that can destroy a lot of text save it, while the ones that
attack only one character, or nothing but blank lines and spaces, do
not save.

For instance, type Ctrl-N a couple times to position the cursor
at some line on this screen.

>> Do this now, move the cursor and kill that line with Ctrl-K.

Note that a single Ctrl-K kills the contents of the line, and a
second Ctrl-K kills the line itself, and makes all the other lines
move up.  If you give Ctrl-K a repeat count, it kills that many lines
AND their contents.

The text that has just disappeared is saved so that you can
retrieve it.  To retrieve the last killed text and put it where
the cursor currently is, type Ctrl-Y.

>> Try it; type Ctrl-Y to yank the text back.

Think of Ctrl-Y as if you were yanking something back that someone
took away from you.  Notice that if you do several Ctrl-K's in a row
the text that is killed is all saved together so that one Ctrl-Y will
yank all of the lines.

>> Do this now, type Ctrl-K several times.

Now to retrieve that killed text:

>> Type Ctrl-Y.  Then move the cursor down a few lines and type Ctrl-Y
   again.  You now see how to copy some text.

What do you do if you have some text you want to yank back, and then
you kill something else?  Ctrl-Y would yank the more recent kill.
But the previous text is not lost.  You can get back to it using the
Alt-Y command.  After you have done Ctrl-Y to get the most recent
kill, typing Alt-Y replaces that yanked text with the previous kill.
Typing Alt-Y again and again brings in earlier and earlier kills.
When you have reached the text you are looking for, you can just go
away and leave it there.  If you Alt-Y enough times, you come back to
the starting point (the most recent kill).

>> Kill a line, move around, kill another line.
   Then do Ctrl-Y to get back the second killed line.
   Then do Alt-Y and it will be replaced by the first killed line.
   Do more Alt-Y's and see what you get.  Keep doing them until
   the second kill line comes back, and then a few more.


UNDO
----

As you move around in the text, inserting and deleting, Epsilon keeps
track of just what you do.  If you decide you've made a mistake, you
can ask Epsilon to undo the last command by pressing F9.  If you
press it again, Epsilon will undo the command before that, and so
forth.

The F10 key puts changes back in, after you've undone them.  Like
undo, it operates one command at a time.  If you press undo ten
times, then press redo eight times, it's as if you've pressed undo
only twice.  (F10 is Epsilon's notation for Function Key 10, which
is probably marked F10 on your keyboard.)

>> Try editing this sentence, killing the last three words and
   inserting them in the middle.  Then press F9 until all the changes
   are undone.  Now press F10 and watch the changes reappear.  You can
   go back and forth through the different versions of the text with
   F9 and F10, as long as you don't use an undoable command, like
   inserting or moving.


FILES
-----

In order to make the text you edit permanent, you must put it in a
file.  Otherwise, it will go away when your invocation of Epsilon goes
away.  You put your editing in a file by "visiting" the file.  What
visiting means is that you see the contents of the file in your Epsilon;
and, loosely speaking, what you are editing is the file itself.
However, the changes still don't become permanent until you "save" the
file.  This is so you can have control to avoid leaving a half-changed
file around when you don't want to.

If you look near the botton of the screen you will see a line that
starts with "myteach".  This is the name of your own temporary copy of
the text of the Epsilon tutorial; the file you are now visiting.
Whatever file you visit, that file's name will appear in that spot.

The commands for visiting and saving files are unlike the other
commands you have learned in that they consist of two characters.
They both start with the character Control-X.  There is a whole
series of commands that start with Control-X; many of them have to do
with files, buffers, and related things, and all of them consist of
Control-X followed by some other character.

Another thing about the command for visiting a file is that you have
to say what file name you want.  We say the command "prompts for an
argument" (in this case, the argument is the name of the file).
After you type the command

    Ctrl-X Ctrl-F   Find a file

Epsilon will ask you for the file name.  You should end the name with
the <Enter> key.  After this command, you will see the contents of
the file in your Epsilon.  You can edit the contents.  When you wish
to make the changes permanent, issue the command

    Ctrl-X Ctrl-S   Save the file

A new version of the file will be created.  When the operation is
finished, Epsilon prints the name of the file.

To make a new file, just visit it "as if" it already existed.  Then
start typing in the text.  When you ask to "save" the file, Epsilon
will really create the file with the text that you have inserted.
From then on, you can consider yourself to be editing an already
existing file.

It is not easy for you to try out visiting a file and continue with
the tutorial.  But you can always come back into the tutorial by
starting it over and skipping forward.  So, when you feel ready, you
should try visiting a file named "FOO", putting some text in it, and
saving it; then exit from Epsilon and look at the file to be sure that
it worked.


EXTENDING THE COMMAND SET
-------------------------

There are many, many more Epsilon commands than could possibly be put
on all the control and alt characters.  Epsilon gets around this with
the X (eXtend) command.  This comes in two flavors:

    Ctrl-X  Character eXtend.  Followed by one character.
    Alt-X   Named command eXtend.  Followed by a long name.

These are commands that are generally useful but used less than the
commands you have already learned about.  You have already seen two
of them: the file commands Ctrl-X Ctrl-F to Find and Ctrl-X Ctrl-S to
Save.  Another example is the command to tell Epsilon that you'd like
to stop editing.  The command to do this is Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z.  Think of
it as Z for zapping yourself.  If some of your files haven't been
saved, Epsilon will give you a chance to change your mind.

There are many Ctrl-X commands.  The ones you need immediately are:

    Ctrl-X Ctrl-F       Find file.
    Ctrl-X Ctrl-S       Save file.
    Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z       Quit Epsilon.  This does NOT save your file.
                        The standard way to save and exit is
                        Ctrl-X Ctrl-S  Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z.

Named eXtended commands are commands which are used even less
frequently, or commands which are used only in certain modes.  These
commands are sometimes called "functions".  An example is the command
replace-string, which globally replaces one string with another.
When you type Alt-X, Epsilon prompts you at the bottom of the screen
with "Alt-X" and you should type the name of the function you wish to
call; in this case, "replace-string".  Just type
"replace-string<Enter>".  Then you type the string that you want to
replace, an <Enter>, the string you want to replace it with, and an
<Enter>.

>> Move the cursor to the blank line two lines below this one.
   Then type Alt-X rep<Esc>changed<Enter>altered<Enter>.

   Notice how this line has changed: you've replaced
   the word c-h-a-n-g-e-d with "altered" wherever it occurs
   after the cursor.


MODE LINE
---------

Epsilon shows you the extended commands as you type them at the
bottom of the screen in an area called the echo area.  The echo area
is the last line of the screen.  The line immediately above it
is called the MODE LINE.  The mode line says something like

   filename [Fundamental] nn% *

This is a very useful "information" line.

You already know what the filename means -- it is the file you have
visited.  What the nn% means is that nn percent of the file is
above the top of the screen.

The star means that you have made changes to the text.  Right after
you visit or save a file, there is no star.

The part of the mode line inside the brackets is to tell you what
modes you are in.  The default mode is Fundamental which is what you
are in now.  It is an example of a "major mode".  There are several
major modes in Epsilon for editing different types of text, such as C
mode, HTML mode, etc.  At any time one and only one major mode is
active, and its name can always be found in the mode line just where
"Fundamental" is now.  Some modes alter the command set only a
little.  For instance, C mode makes closing delimiters like ) and ]
briefly indicate their matching characters, and indents lines of C
code automatically as you type them.  Other modes provide a selection
of new commands on the letter keys, like Dired or Bufed modes.  Each
major mode is the name of an extended command, which is how you get
into the mode.  For example, Alt-X fundamental-mode is how to get
into Fundamental mode.

Major modes are called major because there are also minor modes.
They are called minor because they aren't alternatives to the major
modes, just minor modifications of them.  Each minor mode can be
turned on or off by itself, regardless of what major mode you are in,
and regardless of the other minor modes.  So you can use no minor
modes, or one minor mode, or any combination of several minor modes.

One feature of Epsilon that is very useful, especially for editing
English text, is Auto Fill mode.  When this mode is on, Epsilon
breaks the line in between words automatically whenever the line gets
too long.  You can turn this mode on by doing Alt-X and then typing
"auto<Esc>" using the Escape key (on PC's, a grey key marked Esc in
the top row of keys), and Epsilon will complete the name and execute
the command.  (You could also have typed the command's full name,
auto-fill-mode, after the Alt-X, but it's easier to let Epsilon fill
in the name for you.)  When auto-fill mode is on, you can turn it off
by doing Alt-X auto<Esc> again.  If the mode is off, this function
turns it on, and if the mode is on, this function turns it off.  This
is called "toggling".

>> Type Alt-X auto-fill-mode<Enter> now.  Then insert a line of "asdf "
   over again until you see it divide into two lines.  You must put in
   spaces between them because Auto Fill breaks lines only at spaces.
   Notice that "Fill" appears in the mode line in addition to the name
   of the mode, not instead of it.

The margin is usually set at 70 characters, but you can change it
with the Ctrl-X F command.  You can give the margin setting you want
as a numeric argument.

>> Type Ctrl-X F with an argument of 20.  (Ctrl-U 2 0 Ctrl-X F).
   Then type in some text and see Epsilon fill lines of 20
   characters with it.  Then set the margin back to 70 using
   Ctrl-X F again.


SEARCHING
---------

Epsilon can do searches for strings (these are groups of contiguous
characters or words) either forward through the file or backward
through it.  To search for the string means that you are trying to
locate it somewhere in the file and have Epsilon show you where the
occurrences of the string exist.  This type of search is somewhat
different from what you may be familiar with.  It is a search that is
performed as you type in the thing to search for.  The command to
initiate a search is Ctrl-S for forward search, and Ctrl-R for
reverse search.  BUT WAIT!  Don't do them now.  When you type Ctrl-S
you'll notice that the string "I-Search:" appears as a prompt in the
echo area.  This tells you that Epsilon is in what is called an
incremental search waiting for you to type the thing that you want to
search for.  <Enter> terminates a search.

>> Now type Ctrl-S to start a search.  SLOWLY, one letter at a time,
   type the word 'cursor', pausing after you type each
   character to notice what happens to the cursor.
>> Type Ctrl-S to find the next occurrence of "cursor".
>> Now type <Backspace> four times and see how the cursor moves.
>> Type <Enter> to terminate the search.

Did you see what happened?  Epsilon, in an incremental search, tries
to go to the occurrence of the string that you've typed out so far.
To go to the next occurrence of 'cursor' just type Ctrl-S again.  If
no such occurrence exists Epsilon tells you that it is a failing
search.  Ctrl-G would also terminate the search.

If you are in the middle of an incremental search and type
<Backspace>, you'll notice that the last character in the search
string is erased and the search backs up to the last place of the
search.  For instance, suppose you currently have typed 'cu' and you
see that your cursor is at the first occurrence of 'cu'.  If you now
type <Backspace>, the 'u' on the search line is erased and you'll be
repositioned in the text to the occurrence of 'c' where the search
took you before you typed the 'u'.  This provides a useful means for
backing up while you are searching.

If you are in the middle of a search and happen to type a control or
alt character (other than a Ctrl-S or Ctrl-R, which tell Epsilon to
search for the next occurrence of the string), the search is
terminated.

The Ctrl-S starts a search that looks for any occurrence of the
search string AFTER the current cursor position.  But what if you
want to search for something earlier in the text?  To do this, type
Ctrl-R for Reverse search.  Everything that applies to Ctrl-S applies
to Ctrl-R except that the direction of the search is reversed.


GETTING MORE HELP
-----------------

In this tutorial we have tried to supply just enough information to
get you started using Epsilon.  There is so much available in Epsilon
that it would be impossible to explain it all here.  However, you may
want to learn more about Epsilon since it has numerous desirable
features that you don't know about yet.  Epsilon has a great deal of
internal documentation.  All of these commands can be accessed
through the HELP key, which is F1.  (If you're using Epsilon on a
terminal with no F1 key, or if F1 doesn't work, Ctrl-_ and Alt-? are
synonyms.)

To use the HELP features, type the <HELP> key (an F1), and then a
key saying what kind of help you want.  If you are REALLY lost, type
<HELP> ? and Epsilon will tell you what kinds of help it can give.
If you have typed the <HELP> key and decide you don't want any help,
just type Ctrl-G to abort.

The most basic HELP feature is <HELP> K.  Type <HELP>, a K, and a
command key, and Epsilon prints a description of the command.

>> Type <HELP> K Control-p.  When you are finished reading the output,
type a <Space>.  The message should be something like

    Ctrl-P runs the command up-line.
    Point moves to the previous line.

    The command tries to keep point near the same horizontal position.

This message tells you two things: it describes the command named
"up-line", and it says that one way to run the command is to type
Ctrl-P.  Another way is to type Alt-X and the command's name, of
course, for any command.

Multi-key commands such as Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z are also allowed after
<HELP> K.

Here are some other useful <HELP> options:

   <HELP> C Describe a command by name.  You type in the name of the
            command.

>> Try typing <HELP> C replace-string<Enter>.

   <HELP> A Apropos.  Type in a keyword and Epsilon will list
            all the commands containing that keyword.

>> Type <HELP> A File<Enter>.  You will see a list of all commands
(Alt-x commands) with "file" in their names.  These correspond to keys
like Ctrl-X Ctrl-F and Ctrl-X Ctrl-S.


CONCLUSION
----------

For more information, consult the Epsilon manual.  Remember, to exit
use Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z.
