1Welcome
2Introduction

”CwelcomeWelcome!  We hope you enjoy using Epsilon.  We think you'll find
that Epsilon provides power and flexibility unmatched by any other
editor for a personal computer.

Epsilon has a command set and general philosophy similar to the
EMACS-style editors used on many different kinds of computers.  If
you've used an EMACS-style editor before, you will find Epsilon's
most commonly used commands and keys familiar.  If you haven't used
an EMACS-style editor before, you can use Epsilon's tutorial program.
Chapter 2 tells you how to install Epsilon and how to use the
tutorial program.

2Features

 Full screen editing with an EMACS-style command set.

 An exceptionally powerful embedded programming language, called
EEL, that lets you customize or extend the editor.  EEL provides most
of the expressive power of the C programming language.

 The ability to invoke other programs from within Epsilon.
Under DOS, Epsilon has special features that let you run even very
large programs without leaving the editor.  See Rpushπpush.

 The ability to run some classes of programs concurrently with
the output going to a window.  Under DOS, we know of no other editor
with this feature.  Details appear in Rprocessesπprocesses.

 You can invoke your compiler or "make" program from within
Epsilon, then have Epsilon scan the output for error messages, then
position you at the offending line in your source file.  See Rscanforerrorsπscan-for-errors.

 An undo command that lets you "take back" your last
command, or take back a sequence of commands.  The undo facility
works on both simple and complicated commands.  Epsilon has a
redo command as well, so you can even undo your undo's.  See Rundoπundo.

 Very fast redisplay.  We designed Epsilon specifically for the
personal computer, so it takes advantage of the high available
display bandwidth.

 Epsilon can dynamically syntax-highlight your C, C++, Perl,
Java, or Epsilon extension language programs, showing keywords in one
color, functions in another, string constants in a third, and so
forth.  Epsilon also does syntax highlighting for TeX, HTML, and
other languages.

 You can interactively rearrange the keyboard to suit your
preferences, and save the layout so that Epsilon uses it the next
time.  Epsilon can also emulate the Brief text editor's commands.

 You can edit a virtually unlimited number of files
simultaneously.  On low-memory systems like DOS, Epsilon uses a
ªswap fileº as necessary to make room for the files you want to
edit.

 Epsilon understands Internet URL's and can asynchronously
retrieve and send files via FTP.  Telnet and related commands are
also built in.

 The DOS version uses available EMS and XMS memory.  See Remsπems.

windows Epsilon provides a multi-windowed editing environment, so you
can view several files simultaneously. You can
use as many windows as will fit on the display.  See Rwindowsπwindows.

 For DOS and OS/2, Epsilon has special support for
the expanded screen modes of EGA, VGA, and SVGA boards.

 Non-intrusive mouse support, with a mouse cursor that
disappears when you're not using it, and scroll bars and a menu bar
that don't occupy valuable screen space until you need them.  In DOS,
Epsilon uses an easy-to-position graphic mouse cursor while
maintaining the excellent screen updating performance characteristics
of text mode.

 Under Windows NT or Windows 95/98, Epsilon provides a customizable
tool bar.

 An extensive on-line help system.  You can get help on what any
command does, what any key does, and on what the command executing at
the moment does.  And Epsilon's help system will automatically know
about any rearrangement you make to the keyboard.  See Rhelpπhelp.

 An extensible "tags" system for C, C++, Perl and Assembler
that remembers the locations of subroutine definitions.  You provide
the subroutine name, and Epsilon takes you to the place that defines
that subroutine.  Alternatively, you can position the cursor on a
function call, hit a key, and jump right to the definition of that
function.  See Rtagsπtags.

 Completion on file names and command names.  Epsilon will help
you type the names of files and commands, and display lists of
names that match a pattern that you specify.  You can complete on
many other classes of names too.  This saves you a lot of typing.
See Rcompletionπcompletion.

 Under Windows, you can drag and drop files or directories onto
Epsilon's window, and Epsilon will open them.

 Commands to manipulate words, sentences, paragraphs, and
parenthetic expressions.  See the commands in Rwordcmdsπwordcmds.

 Indenting and formatting commands.  Details appear in Rformatπformat.

 A kill ring to store text you've previously deleted.  You can set the
number of such items to save.  See Rkillbufsπkillbufs.

 A convenient ªincremental searchº command (described in Rincrementalsearchπincrementalsearch), as well as regular searching
commands, and search-and-replace commands.

 Regular expression searches.  With regular expressions you can
search for complex patterns, using such things as wildcards,
character classes, alternation, and repeating.

 A fast ªgrepº command that lets you search across a set of
files.  See Rgrepcmdπgrep-cmd.  You can also replace text in a
set of files.

 Extended file patterns that let you easily search out files on
a disk.

 A directory editing command that lets you navigate among
directories, copying, moving, and deleting files as needed.  It even
works on remote directories via FTP.

 Fast ªsortº commands that let you quickly sort a buffer.
See Rsortcmdsπsort-cmds.

 A powerful ªkeyboard macroº facility (see Rmacsπmacs), that allows you to execute sequences of keystrokes
as a unit, and to extend the command set of the editor.  You'll find
Epsilon's keyboard macros very easy to define and use.

 Commands to compare two files and find the differences between
them.  You can compare character-by-character or line-by-line.
See Rcompareπcompare.

 You can choose from a variety of built-in screen layouts,
making Epsilon's screen look like those of other editors, or
customize your own look for the editor.

1Getting Started

installationRinstall”CstartedThis chapter tells you how to install Epsilon on your
system and explains how to invoke Epsilon.  We also describe how to
run the tutorial, and catalog the contents of the distribution
diskettes.

2Windows Installation

Epsilon for Windows is provided as a self-installing Windows
executable.    Run the program

Ωr:¥setup.exe≤æ≤
where r represents your CD-ROM drive.

You can also use Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.  Under
older versions of Windows, use the Program Manager's File/Run command
to run the program.

Whichever way you run it, the installation program lets you
select which versions of Epsilon to install:

 By default it installs the 32-bit GUI version of Epsilon for
Windows, and the 32-bit console version.  These programs are named
epsilon.exe and epsilonc.exe, respectively.

 You can also select the 16-bit DOS version, but it is not
selected by default.  The console version and the DOS version have a
similar appearance, and both will run in Windows 95/98/NT, but of the
two, only the Win32 console version can use long file names or the
clipboard under NT.  The DOS version is named epsdos.exe.

 You can also select the 16-bit Windows 3.1 version, but it is not
selected by default.  (When installing on 16-bit Windows, this
version is selected instead of the 32-bit versions.)



The installation program will prompt you for any necessary
information, and guide you through the installation process.

The installation program creates program items to run Epsilon.  Under
Windows 95/98 or NT, it also sets the registry entry Software¥Lugaru¥Epsilon¥EpsPath»version… in the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER hierarchy to the name of the directory in which
you installed Epsilon (where »version… represents Epsilon's
version number).

VxDUnder Windows 95/98, the installation program directs the
system to install Epsilon's VxD each time it starts, by creating the
registry entry System¥CurrentControlSet¥Services¥VxD¥Epsilon»version…¥StaticVxD in the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hierarchy.  If you're running Windows 95/98,
the program will warn that you must restart Windows before the
concurrent process will work.

386Enh sectionsystem.ini filelugeps.ini
fileUnder Windows 3.1, the installation program directs the system to
install Epsilon's VxD each time it starts, by adding a device= line
to the 386Enh section of your system.ini file.  The program will warn
that you must restart Windows before the concurrent process will
work.  The installation program also adds lines to the file
lugeps.ini in your Windows directory, creating the file if necessary.

Under Windows NT 3.5 or Windows 3.1, the installer also creates a
program item to uninstall Epsilon.  Under Windows 95/98 or Windows 4.0,
you can uninstall Epsilon by using Add/Remove Programs in the Control
Panel.

2Unix Installation

installation, for UnixInstalling Epsilon for Unix

Epsilon includes a version for Linux and a separate version for
FreeBSD.  We describe them collectively as the "Unix" version of
Epsilon.  To install either one, mount the CD-ROM, typically by
typing

Ωmount /cdromæ

Then, as root, run the appropriate shell script.  For
Linux, that would be

Ω/cdrom/linux/einstallæ

and for FreeBSD that would be

Ω/cdrom/freebsd/einstallæ

The installation script will prompt you for any necessary information.

(Under Linux, you may need to provide the -o exec option to the
mount command.)

If for some reason that doesn't work, you can manually perform the few
steps needed to install Epsilon.  For Epsilon for Linux, you would
type, as root:

Ωcd /usr/local≤tar xzf /cdrom/linux/epsilon10.tar.gz≤cd epsilon10≤./esetup≤æ≤
For FreeBSD, substitute freebsd for linux in the
second command.

You can also install Epsilon in a private directory, if you don't
have root access.  In that case you will also need to define an
environment variable so Epsilon can locate its files, such as

ΩglibcNSS shared fileslibnss shared
filesEPSPATH1001=~/.epsilon:/home/bob/epsilon10.01≤æ≤
Epsilon for Linux normally uses certain shared library files from the
glibc 2.1 NSS subsystem.  These have names such as the following:

ΩUnix, Epsilon for/lib/libnss_files.so.2≤/lib/libnss_dns.so.2≤æ≤
If the installation script cannot find these shared library
files, it will compile a helper program to provide Epsilon with the
necessary services.

Epsilon runs as an X program within X and as
a text program outside of X.  Epsilon knows to use X when it inherits
a DISPLAY environment variable.  You can override Epsilon's
determination by providing a -vt flag to make Epsilon run as a
text program, or an appropriate -display flag to make Epsilon
connect to a given X server.

Epsilon also recognizes these standard X flags:
Œ-bw »pixels… or -borderwidth
»pixels…This flag sets the width of the window border in
pixels.  An Epsilon.borderWidth resource may be used instead.

Œ-fn »font… or -font »font… This flag
specifies the font to use.  The Alt-x set-font command can
select a different font from within Epsilon.  It provides completion,
and shows you possible font names when you press "?".  But Epsilon
will not retain this setting the next time you start it.  To make
Epsilon use a different font when it starts, you can add an entry
like this to your X resources file.  See below.

Œ-geometry »geometry… This flag sets the window
size and position, using the standard X syntax.  Without this flag,
Epsilon looks for an Epsilon.geometry resource.

Œ-name »resname… This flag tells Epsilon to look
for X resources using a name other than Epsilon.

Œ-title »title… This flag sets the title Epsilon
displays while starting.  An Epsilon.title resource may be used
instead.

Œ-xrm »resourcestring… This flag specifies a
specific resource name and value, overriding any defaults.



Epsilon uses various X resources.  You can set them from the command
line with a flag like -xrm Epsilon.cursorstyle:1 or put a line
like Epsilon.cursorstyle:1 in your X resources file, which is
usually named ~/.Xdefaults:

ΩEpsilon.font: lucidasanstypewriter-bold-14æ

You'll need to tell X to reread the file after making such a change,
using a command like xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults.

Epsilon uses these X resources:
ŒEpsilon.borderWidth This sets the width of the border around
Epsilon's window.

ŒEpsilon.cursorstyle Under X, Epsilon displays a block cursor
whose shape does not change.  Define a cursorstyle resource with
value 1 and Epsilon will use a line-style cursor, sized to reflect
overwrite mode or virtual space mode.  Note this cursor style does
not display correctly on some X servers.

ŒEpsilon.font This resource sets Epsilon's font.  It must be a
fixed-width font.

ŒEpsilon.geometry This resource provides a geometry setting for
Epsilon.  See the -geometry flag above.

ŒEpsilon.title This resource sets the title Epsilon displays
while starting.



2DOS Installation

installation, for DOSInstalling Epsilon for DOS
You can install Epsilon for DOS in
two ways.  On a machine running Windows, use the
Windows-based installer as described in a previous section.  On a
machine without Windows, cd to the ¥DOS directory on the
Epsilon CD-ROM.  Run Epsilon's installation program by
typing:

Ωinstallæ

Follow the directions on the screen to install Epsilon.  The
installation program will ask before it modifies or replaces any
system files.  A list of files provided with Epsilon appears in Rfilelistπfilelist.

2OS/2 Installation

Installing Epsilon for
OS/2installation, for OS/2To install Epsilon, start a command prompt and cd to the
¥OS2 directory on the Epsilon CD-ROM.  Run Epsilon's
installation program by typing:

Ωinstallæ

Follow the directions on the screen to install Epsilon.  The
installation program will ask before it modifies or replaces any
system files.  A list of files provided with Epsilon appears in Rfilelistπfilelist.

You can install Epsilon for OS/2 in the same directory as the Windows
or DOS versions of Epsilon.  To do this, use the Windows-based
installer first, and install all desired components.  Then run the
OS/2 installer and select the option to only install OS/2-specific
files.

2Epsilon Tutorial

tutorialRtutorial
Once you install Epsilon, put the distribution disks away.  If you've
never used Epsilon or EMACS before, you should run the
tutorial to become acquainted with some of Epsilon's
simpler commands.

The easiest way to run the tutorial is to start Epsilon and select
Epsilon Tutorial from the Help menu.  (If you're running a version of
Epsilon without a menu bar, you can instead press the F2 key in
Epsilon and type the command name tutorial.  Or you can start
Epsilon with the -teach flag.)

The tutorial will tell you everything else you need to know to use
the tutorial, including how to exit the tutorial.

2Invoking Epsilon

Epsilon, commandinvoking Epsilonstarting EpsilonRstartup

You can start Epsilon for Windows using the icon created by the
installer.  Under other operating systems, you can run Epsilon by
simply typing "epsilon".

Depending on your installation options, you can also run Epsilon for
Windows from the command line.  Type "epsilon" to run Epsilon for
Windows 95/98/NT, or "e16" to run Epsilon for Windows 3.1.  Under
Windows, "epsilonc" runs the Win32 console version of Epsilon, while
"epsdos" runs the DOS version, if these are installed.

The first time you run Epsilon, you will get a single window
containing an empty document.  You can give Epsilon the name of a
file to edit on the command line.  For example, if you type

Ωepsilon sample.cæ

then Epsilon will start up and read in the file
sample.c.  If the file name contains spaces, surround the entire
name with double-quote characters.

Ωcommand line, for Epsilonepsilon "a sample file.c"æ

When you name several files on the command line,
Epsilon reads each one in, but
puts only up to three in windows (so as not to clutter the screen
with tiny windows).  You can set this number by modifying the
¬max-initial-windows≈max-initial-windows variable.

If you specify files on the command line with wild cards, Epsilon
will show you a list of the files that match the pattern in
¬dired mode.  See Rdiredπdired for more information on
how dired works.  File names that contain only extended
wildcard characters like , ; [ or ], and no standard wildcard
characters like * or ?, will be interpreted as file names, not file
patterns.  (If you set the variable ¬expand-wildcards≈expand-wildcards to 1,
Epsilon will instead read in each file that matches the pattern, as
if you had listed them explicitly.  Epsilon for Unix does this too
unless you quote the file pattern.)

Epsilon normally shows you the beginning of each file you name on the
command line.  If you want to start at a different line, put
"+»number…" before the file's name, where »number… indicates
the line number to go to.  You can follow the line number with a
:column number too.  For example, if you typed

Ω+
command line optionepsilon +26 file.one +144:20 file.twoæ

then you would get file.one with the cursor at the start of
line 26, and file.two with the cursor at line 144, column 20.

By default, Epsilon will also read any files you were editing in your
previous editing session, in addition to those you name on the
command line.  See Rsessionπsession for details.

2Configuration Variables

configuration variableRenvironmentRconfigvarsVersions of Epsilon for Unix,
DOS, and OS/2 use several environment variables to set options and
say where to look for files.  Epsilon for Windows 3.1 looks for
settings like these in the file lugeps.ini, in your main Windows
directory.  Epsilon for Windows 95/98 or NT stores such settings in
the System Registry, under the key
HKEY_CURRENT_USER¥SOFTWARE¥Lugaru¥Epsilon.  Epsilon's setup
program will generally create all necessary registry keys or
lugeps.ini entries automatically.

We use the term ªconfiguration variableº to refer to any setting
that appears as an environment variable, a registry entry, or a
lugeps.ini entry, depending on Epsilon's operating system platform.
There are a small number of settings that are stored in environment
variables on all platforms; these are generally settings that are
provided by the operating system.  These include COMSPEC, TMP or
TEMP, EPSRUNS, and MIXEDCASEDRIVES.  Also, the EEL compiler uses the
environment variables EEL and EPSPATH (except under Windows 95/98/NT,
where it uses configuration variables by these names).

In DOS or OS/2, you can set environment variables using the command
processor's "set" command:

Ωset epspath=c:\epsilonæ

Put this command in your autoexec.bat file, under DOS, or in your
config.sys file, under OS/2, so that you don't have to type it each
time.  Make sure there are no spaces before or after the = sign,
or at the end of the line.  In Unix, see your shell's documentation
for directions on setting environment variables.  For sh and bash,
you can use EPSPATH=/some/path; export EPSPATH.

Under Windows 3.1, the installation program automatically adds a
similar line to set the EpsPath to the lugeps.ini file in your main
Windows directory (creating it if necessary).  It looks like this:

Ω[Misc]≤EpsPath=c:¥epsdir≤æ≤
Similarly, under Windows 95/98 or Windows NT, the installation program
creates a registry entry similar to this:

ΩHKEY_CURRENT_USER¥SOFTWARE¥Lugaru¥Epsilon¥EpsPath=c:\epsilonæ

Of course, the actual entry, whether it's an environment variable
setting in an autoexec.bat file, an .ini file entry, or an entry in
the system registry, would contain whatever directory Epsilon was
actually installed in, not c:\epsilon.

If you have more than one version of Epsilon on your computer, you
may want each to use a different set of options.  You can override
many of the configuration variables listed below by using a
configuration variable whose name includes the specific version of
Epsilon in use.  For example, when Epsilon needs to locate its help
file, it normally uses a configuration variable named EPSPATH.
Epsilon version 6.01 would first check to see if a configuration
variable named EPSPATH601 existed.  If so, it would use that
variable.  If not, it would then try EPSPATH60, then EPSPATH6, and
finally EPSPATH.  Epsilon does the same sort of thing with all
the configuration variables it uses, with the exception of DISPLAY,
EPSRUNS, TEMP, and TMP.

Epsilon uses a similar procedure to distinguish registry entries for
the Win32 console mode version from registry entries for the Win32
GUI version of Epsilon.  For the console version, it checks registry
names with an -NTCON suffix before the actual names; for the GUI
version it checks for a -WIN suffix.  So Epsilon 10.2 for Win32 console
would seek an EPSPATH configuration variable using the names
EPSPATH102-NTCON, EPSPATH102, EPSPATH10-NTCON, EPSPATH10,
EPSPATH-NTCON, and finally EPSPATH, using the first one it finds.

For example, the Windows installation program for Epsilon doesn't
actually add the EPSPATH entry shown above to the system registry.
It really uses an entry like

ΩHKEY_CURRENT_USER¥SOFTWARE¥Lugaru¥Epsilon¥EpsPath80=c:\epsilonæ

where EpsPath80 indicates that the entry should be used by
version 8.0 of Epsilon, or version 8.01, or 8.02, but not by version
8.5.  In this way, multiple versions of Epsilon can be installed at
once, without overwriting each other's settings.  This can be helpful
when upgrading Epsilon from one version to the next.

Here we list all the configuration variables that Epsilon can use.
Remember, under Windows, most of these names refer to entries in the
System Registry or a lugeps.ini file, as described above.  Under
Unix, DOS, and OS/2, these are all environment variables.
ŒCMDCONCURSHELLFLAGS If defined, Epsilon puts the contents of
this variable before the command line when you use the
start-process command with a numeric argument.  It overrides
CMDSHELLFLAGS.  See Rprocessesπprocesses.

ŒCMDSHELLFLAGS If defined, Epsilon puts the contents of this
variable before the command line when it runs a subshell that should
execute a single command and exit.

RCOMSPECCOMSPEC, environment variableEPSCOMSPEC, configuration variableŒCOMSPEC Epsilon needs a valid
COMSPEC environment variable in order to run
another program.  Normally, the operating system automatically sets
up this variable to give the file name of your command processor.  If
you change the variable manually, remember that the file must
actually exist.  Don't include command line options for your command
processor in the COMSPEC variable.  If a configuration variable
called EPSCOMSPEC exists, Epsilon will use that
instead of COMSPEC.  (For Unix, see SHELL below.)

ŒDISPLAY Epsilon for Unix tries to run as an X program if this
environment variable is defined, using the X server display it
specifies.

ŒEEL The EEL compiler looks for an environment variable named
EEL before examining its command line, then "types in" the contents
of that variable before the compiler's real command line.  See Reelflagsπeelflags.  Under Windows 95/98/NT, the EEL compiler uses a
registry entry named EEL (a "configuration variable", as described
above), not an environment variable.

ŒEPSCOMSPEC See COMSPEC above.

ŒEPSCONCURCOMSPEC If defined, Epsilon for Windows, DOS or OS/2
runs the shell command processor named by this variable instead of
the one named by the EPSCOMSPEC or COMSPEC variables, when it starts
a concurrent process.  See Rprocessesπprocesses.

ŒEPSCONCURSHELL If defined, Epsilon for Unix runs the
shell command processor named by this variable instead of the one
named by the EPSSHELL or SHELL variables, when it starts a
concurrent process.  See Rprocessesπprocesses.

ŒEPSILON Before examining the command line, Epsilon looks for
a configuration variable named EPSILON and "types in" the value of
that variable to the command line before the real command line.  See Rcomlineπcomline.

ŒEPSMIXEDCASEDRIVES This variable can contain a list of drive
letters.  If the variable exists, Epsilon doesn't change the case of
file names on the listed drives.  See Rmixedcasedrivesπmixedcasedrives
for details.

REPSPATHauxiliary filesEPSPATH, configuration variableŒEPSPATH Sometimes Epsilon needs to locate one of its files.
For example,
Epsilon needs to read an .mnu file like gui.mnu or epsilon.mnu to
determine what commands go in its menu bar.  Epsilon searches
directories in this order:

¢1. The directory containing the Epsilon executable, then the parent
of that directory.  The -w4 and -w8 flags, respectively,
tell Epsilon to skip these two steps.  If you tell Epsilon's
Windows installer to put Epsilon's executable files in a common
directory with other executable programs, the installer will set up
Epsilon to use these flags by creating an EPSILON configuration
variable.  (Epsilon for Unix doesn't look in the parent directory.)

¢2. The directories specified by the EPSPATH configuration variable.
This configuration variable should contain a list of directories
separated by semicolons.  Epsilon will then look for the file in each
of these directories.  The installer creates an EPSPATH configuration
variable containing Epsilon's installation directory.  (In Epsilon
for Unix, a missing EPSPATH variable causes Epsilon to look in
/usr/local/epsilon»VER… (where »VER… is replaced by text
representing the current version, such as 101 for 10.1), then
/usr/local/epsilon and then /opt/epsilon.  In other versions, a
missing EPSPATH makes Epsilon skip this step.)

¢The EEL compiler also uses the EPSPATH environment variable.  See Rincludepathπincludepath.

EPSRUNS, environment variableŒEPSRUNS Epsilon uses this environment
variable to warn you when you try to start Epsilon from within a
shell started by an earlier invocation of Epsilon.  Epsilon refuses
to start, giving an error message, if this variable exists in the
environment.  Otherwise, Epsilon inserts this variable into its copy
of the environment and passes it on to its subprocesses.  (Windows
and Unix versions set this variable, but don't check for it.)

ŒEPSSHELL See SHELL below.

ŒESESSION Epsilon uses this variable as the name of its
session file.  See Rsessionπsession.

ŒINTERCONCURSHELLFLAGS If defined, Epsilon uses the contents
of this variable as the command line to the shell command processor
it starts when you use the start-process command without a
numeric argument.  It overrides INTERSHELLFLAGS.  See Rprocessesπprocesses.

ŒINTERSHELLFLAGS If defined, Epsilon uses the contents of this
variable as a subshell command line when it runs a subshell that
should prompt for a series of commands to execute.  See Rprocessesπprocesses.

ŒMIXEDCASEDRIVES This variable can contain a list of drive
letters.  If the variable exists, Epsilon doesn't change the case of
file names on the listed drives.  See Rmixedcasedrivesπmixedcasedrives
for details.

PATH, environment variableŒPATH The operating system uses this variable
to find executable programs such as epsilon.exe.  Make sure this
variable includes the directory containing Epsilon's executable files
(by default \epsilon\bin in Windows).

RSHELLSHELL, environment variableEPSSHELL, configuration variableŒSHELL Epsilon for Unix needs a valid
SHELL environment variable in order to run
another program.  If a configuration variable called
EPSSHELL exists, Epsilon will use that instead
of SHELL.  (See COMSPEC above for the non-Unix equivalent.)

ŒTEMP Epsilon puts any swap or shrink files it creates in this
directory, unless a TMP environment variable exists.  See the
description of the -fs flag in Rswapfileπswapfile.

ŒTMP Epsilon puts any swap or shrink files it creates in this
directory.  See the description of the -fs flag in Rswapfileπswapfile.

2Epsilon Command Line

initialization, of EpsilonEPSILON, configuration variableflags, for
Epsilonswitches, for EpsilonRepsenvvarRcomlineWhen you start Epsilon, you may specify a sequence of command
line flags (also known as command-line options, or switches) to alter
Epsilon's behavior.  Flags must go before any file name.  Each flag
consists of a minus sign ("-"), a letter, and sometimes a
parameter.  Never put a space between a flag and its parameter.

Before examining the command line, Epsilon looks
for a configuration variable (see Rconfigvarsπconfigvars) named
EPSILON and "types in" the value of that variable to the command
line before the real command line.  Thus, if you
give the DOS or OS/2 command
processor the command:

Ωset epsilon=-m250000 -smineæ

then Epsilon would behave as if you had typed

Ωepsilon -m250000 -smine myfileæ

when you actually type

ΩRswitches F-add, command line flag F-b, command line flagepsilon myfileæ

Here we list all of the flags, and what they do:
Œ+»number… Epsilon normally shows you the beginning of each
file you name on the command line.  If you want to start at a
different line, put "+»number…" before the file's name, where
»number… indicates the line number to go to.  You can follow
the line number with a colon and a column number if you wish.

Œ-add This flag tells Epsilon for Windows to locate
an existing instance of Epsilon, pass it the rest of the command line
via DDE, and exit.  (Epsilon ignores the flag if there's no prior
instance.)  If you want to configure another program to run Epsilon
to edit a file, but use an existing instance of Epsilon if there is
one, just include this flag in the Epsilon command line.  See RDDEπDDE for details on Epsilon's DDE support.

bytecode filesŒ-b»filename… Epsilon normally reads all its commands
from a state file at startup.  (See the -s flag below.)
Alternately, you can have Epsilon start up from a file generated
directly by the EEL compiler.  These ªbytecode filesº end with a
".b" extension.  This flag says to
use the bytecode file with name »filename…, or "epsilon" if you
leave out the »filename….  You may omit the extension in »filename….
You would rarely use this flag, except when building a new
version of Epsilon from scratch.  Compare the -l flag.

 F-d, command line flagŒ-d»variable!value… You can use this flag to set the
values of string and integer variables from the command line.  The
indicated variable must already exist at startup.  You can also use
the syntax -d»variable=value…, but beware: if you run Epsilon
via a .BAT or .CMD file, the system will replace any ='s with
spaces, and Epsilon will not correctly interpret the flag.

 F-dde, command line flagŒ-dde:»servername… (Windows only) The command line
flag -dde may be used to alter the DDE server name for an
instance of Epsilon.  An instance of Epsilon started with
-dde:»somename… -add will only pass its command line
to a previous instance started with the same
-dde:»somename… flag.

Œ-e flags See Rdosflagsπdosflags for information on
these DOS-specific flags.

Rfdswitch
edoc file
help command, file F-fd, command line flagŒ-fd»filename… This flag tells Epsilon where to
look for the on-line documentation file.  Normally, Epsilon looks for
a file named edoc.  This flag tells Epsilon to use »filename… for
the documentation file. If you provide a relative name for
»filename…, then Epsilon will search for it; see REPSPATHπEPSPATH.  Use a file name, not a directory name, for
»filename….

Rfhswitch F-fh, command line flagshrinkingŒ-fh»dirnames… (DOS and Windows only)
This switch tells Epsilon what directories to use for
the temporary files it creates under DOS during "shrinking" and
"capturing."  When Epsilon runs another program, it can move itself
out of memory to give the other program more room.  We call this
ªshrinkingº.  Epsilon can also capture the output of programs it
runs, to read compiler error messages, for example.  Epsilon creates
temporary files when you use either of these features (by running the
push or make commands, for example) and this switch
lets you tell Epsilon where to put these files.  (Only the DOS
version of Epsilon, not the Windows version, uses a shrink file, but
both use capture files.)  When you use this switch, »dirnames…
should specify a list of one or more directories, separated by
semicolons.

¢When Epsilon needs to create temporary files, it looks through the
list of directories »dirnames… for a directory with enough free
space.  If none have enough, it looks through its list of swap
directories (described next) for one with space.  If none of those
have enough, it will ask you for a directory name for temporary
files.  If you don't use this switch, Epsilon will go immediately to
the list of swap directories.

¢eshrink fileeshell
filefile, eshrinkfile, eshellFor shrinking and
capturing, Epsilon uses temporary files named eshrink and eshell.
However, Epsilon will modify the names to avoid a conflict with
another Epsilon using these files.

 F-fs, command line flagŒ-fs»dirnames… This switch tells Epsilon what
directories to use for swap files, if Epsilon needs to use them.
»Dirnames… should indicate a list of one or more directories,
separated by semicolons.
Epsilon will always create its first swap file in the first directory
named.  If it finds that it can no longer expand that file, it will
switch to the second directory, and so forth.  If it cannot find any
available space, it will ask you for another directory
name.

swap fileRswapfile¢
eswap fileTMP, environment variableTEMP, environment variableIf you don't use this switch, Epsilon
will create any swap file it needs in the directory named by the TMP
environment variable.  If TMP doesn't exist, Epsilon tries TEMP.
If Epsilon can't find either, it will create any swap file it needs
in the root directory of the drive from which you started Epsilon.
Epsilon calls its swap file eswap, but it will use another name (like
eswap0, eswap1, etc.) to avoid a conflict with another Epsilon using
this file.  (Under DOS, be sure to load DOS's share.exe program so
that Epsilon can detect these conflicts.)

 F-geometry, command line flagŒ-geometry When Epsilon for Unix runs as an X program,
it recognizes this standard X flag.

Œ-k flags See Rdosflagsπdosflags for information on
other DOS and OS/2-specific -k flags.

 Rkflag F-ka, command line flagŒ-ka»number… (Windows only) This
switch turns off certain keyboard functions to help diagnose
problems.  It's followed by a number.  -ka1 tells Epsilon not to
translate the Ctrl-2 key combination to NUL.  -ka2 tells Epsilon
not to translate the Ctrl-⁄Space€ key combination to NUL.
-ka4 tells Epsilon to try to work around a caret-related screen
painting bug on some Windows 3.1 display cards.

extended keys
101-key keyboard
keyboard, 101-key F-ke, command line flagŒ-ke This switch tells Epsilon that
your computer has an extended keyboard with a separate cursor pad.
If you don't provide this switch, cursor pad keys will function the
same as the corresponding numeric pad keys.  If you use this switch,
you can bind different commands to the two sets of keys. See Rkeynamesπkeynames.  The exact keyboard changes made by this switch
vary based on the operating system under which Epsilon is running.

 F-ks, command line flagŒ-ks»number… (Windows & OS/2 only) This flag lets
you manually adjust the emphasis Epsilon puts on speed during long
operations versus responsiveness to the abort key.  Higher numbers
make Epsilon slightly faster overall, but when you press the abort
key, Epsilon may not respond as quickly.  Lower numbers make Epsilon
respond more quickly to the abort key, but with a performance
penalty.  The default setting is -ks100.

 F-l, command line flagŒ-l»bytecode… Giving this switch makes Epsilon load a
bytecode file named »bytecode….b after loading the state file.  If
you give more than one -l flag on the command line, the files
load in the order they appear.  Compare the -b flag.

Rmflag F-m, command line flagŒ-m»bytes… This switch controls how
much memory Epsilon uses. Epsilon interprets a number less than 1000
as a number of kilobytes, otherwise, as bytes.  You may explicitly
specify kilobytes by ending »bytes… with "k", or megabytes by
ending »bytes… with "m".  Specify -m0 to use as little
memory as possible, and -m to put no limit on memory use.

¢Except under DOS, this flag tells Epsilon how much memory it may use
for the text of buffers.  If you read in more files than will fit in
the specified amount of memory, or if despite a high limit, the
operating system refuses Epsilon's requests for more memory, Epsilon
will swap portions of the files to disk.  By default, Epsilon puts no
limits on its own memory usage.

¢conventional memoryUnder DOS, this flag tells Epsilon how much "conventional memory"
it should reserve for buffer text when it starts a concurrent
process.  By default, Epsilon reserves
about 25% of the available memory for buffer text before it starts a
concurrent process.  This flag does not affect the amount of UMB,
UMA, EMS or XMS memory Epsilon uses, but the presence of these types
of memory can reduce Epsilon's need for conventional memory.  See the
description of the -e and -x flags for more information on
these other types of memory.

 F-nodde, command line flagŒ-nodde This flag tells Epsilon for Windows that it
should not register itself as a DDE server and accept DDE messages
from other programs.  By default, Epsilon will receive DDE messages
sent via file associations or from future instances of Epsilon that
are started with the -add flag.  See RDDEπDDE for
details.

Œ-p»filename…This overrides the ESESSION configuration
variable to control the name of the session file that Epsilon
uses.  When you specify a file name, Epsilon uses that for the
session file, just as with ESESSION.  Because the -p0 and
-p1 flags enable and disable sessions (see the next item), the
given »filename… must not begin with a digit.

Rpflag F-p, command line flagŒ-p»number… This flag controls whether or not Epsilon
restores your previous session when it starts up.  By default,
Epsilon will try to restore your previous window and buffer
configuration.  The -p flag with no number toggles whether
Epsilon restores the session.  Give the -p0 flag to disable
session restoring and saving, and the -p1 flag to enable session
restoring and saving.  This flag simply sets the
¬preserve-session≈preserve-session variable; see its description for other
options.

 F-quickup, command line flagŒ-quickup Epsilon uses this flag to help perform certain
updates.  It searches for and loads a bytecode file named quickup.b.
This flag is similar to the -l flag above, but the -quickup
flag doesn't require any EEL functions to run.  For that reason, it
can replace and update any EEL function.

 F-r, command line flagŒ-r»command… Giving this switch makes Epsilon try to
run a command or keyboard macro named »command… at startup.  If the
command doesn't exist, nothing happens.  If you specify more than one
-r flag on the command line, they execute in the order they
appear.

 F-s, command line flagstate fileŒ-s»filename… When Epsilon starts up, it looks
for a ªstate fileº named epsilon.sta.  The state file contains
definitions for all of Epsilon's commands.  You can create your own
state file by using the write-state command.  This switch
says to use the state file with the name »filename….  Epsilon will
add the appropriate extension if you omit it.  Specify a file name
for »filename…, not a directory name.  Of course, the file name
may include a directory or drive prefix.  If you specify a relative
file name, Epsilon will search for it.  See REPSPATHπEPSPATH.  See also the -b flag, described above.

 F-teach, command line flagŒ-teach This flag tells Epsilon to load the on-line
tutorial file at startup.  See Rtutorialπtutorial.

Œ-v flags See Rdosvideoflagsπdosvideoflags for
information on other DOS-specific -v flags.

 F-vc, command line flagŒ-vc»x… »x… indicates the number of columns
you want displayed while in Epsilon.  For example, if your display
board has 132 columns, use the "-vc132" flag.  See the -vl
flag, described below.  See the -geometry flag for the equivalent in
Epsilon for Unix.

 F-vcolor, command line flagŒ-vcolor Epsilon normally tries to determine whether to
use a monochrome color scheme or a full-color one based on the type
of display in use and its mode.  This flag forces Epsilon to use a
full-color color scheme, regardless of the type of the display.

Rvlswitch F-vl, command line flagŒ-vl»x… »x… indicates the number of
screen lines you want to use while in Epsilon.  See the -vc switch,
described above, and the discussion of display modes in Rdisplaymodesπdisplaymodes.  See -geometry for the equivalent in
Epsilon for Unix.

Rmono F-vmono, command line flagŒ-vmono Epsilon normally tries to determine
whether to use a monochrome color scheme or a full-color one based on
the type of display in use and its mode.  This flag forces Epsilon to
use its monochrome color scheme, regardless of the type of the
display.

 F-vt, command line flagcurses programterminal
program under XxtermŒ-vt (Unix only) This flag forces Epsilon to run as a
curses-style terminal program, not an X program.  By default Epsilon
for Unix runs as an X program whenever an X display is specified
(either through a DISPLAY environment variable or a -display
flag), and a terminal program otherwise.

 F-vv, command line flagŒ-vv This flag instructs Epsilon to split the screen
vertically, not horizontally, when more than one file is specified on
the command line.

 F-vx, command line flag F-vy, command line flagŒ-vx and -vy These flags let you specify the
position of Epsilon's window in Epsilon for Windows.  For example,
-vx20 -vy30 positions the upper left corner of Epsilon's window
at pixel coordinates 20x30.  See -geometry for the equivalent in
Epsilon for Unix.

Rwflag F-w, command line flagŒ-w»number… This flag controls several
directory-related settings.  Follow it with a number.

¢The -w1 flag tells Epsilon to remember the current directory
from session to session.  Without this flag, Epsilon will remain in
whatever current directory it was started from.  Epsilon always
records the current directory when it writes a session file; this
flag only affects whether or not Epsilon uses this information when
reading a session file.

¢The -w2 flag has no effect in this version of Epsilon.

¢The -w4 flag tells Epsilon not to look for its own files in the
directory containing the Epsilon executable.  Similarly, the -w8
flag tells Epsilon not to look for its own files in the parent of the
directory containing the Epsilon executable.  Epsilon normally looks
for its own files in these two directories, prior to searching the
EPSPATH.  If you choose to put Epsilon's executable files in a common
directory with other executable files, you may wish to set this flag.
If you do this, make sure the EPSPATH points to the correct directory.

¢The -w16 flag tells Epsilon to set its current directory to the
directory containing the first file named on its command line.  If
you edit files by dragging and dropping them onto a shortcut to
Epsilon, you may wish to use this flag in the shortcut.

¢You can combine -w flags by adding their values together.  For
example, -w5 makes Epsilon remember the current directory and
exclude its executable's directory from the EPSPATH.  All Windows
program icons for Epsilon invoke it with -w1 so that Epsilon
remembers the current directory.  (When you tell the installer to put
Epsilon's executables in a common directory, not in Epsilon's normal
directory structure, the installer uses the -w13 flag in
Epsilon's icons, and the -w12 flag when Epsilon is invoked from
the command line.  Epsilon then relies on the EPSPATH setting to find
its files.)

Œ-x flags See Rxmsflagsπxmsflags for information on
the DOS-specific -x flags.

3DOS-specific and OS/2-specific Flags

 F-ef, command line flag F-e, command line flagEMS memoryRemsRdosflagsThis section describes some flags that are only used
in Epsilon for DOS or Epsilon for OS/2.
Œ-e»bytes… (DOS only)
This switch controls Epsilon's use of expanded memory, or
EMS, for storing text.  »Bytes… may end with "k" to indicate
kilobytes, or 'm' to indicate megabytes.  Without either suffix,
Epsilon interprets a number less than 1000 as a number of kilobytes,
otherwise as a number of bytes.

¢You may specify -e0 to disable all use of EMS memory, or -e
to place no limit on Epsilon's use of EMS memory (the default).  This
latter switch may come in handy to override a prior limit
(perhaps from an EPSILON configuration variable).

Œ-ef»bytes… (DOS only) This switch controls Epsilon's
use of expanded memory, or EMS, for storing commands.  By default,
Epsilon loads its commands into about 80k bytes of EMS memory.  This
frees more memory for a concurrent process.  You may specify
-ef0 to make Epsilon not put commands in EMS memory.  Or you may
specify -ef by itself to override a prior -e0 flag, and
permit Epsilon to use EMS memory only for commands, not buffers.

 F-ei, command line flagŒ-ei»bytes… (DOS only) By default, Epsilon tries to
allocate EMS memory in blocks of 256k bytes.  This flag sets the
allocation size.  »Bytes… may end with "k" to indicate kilobytes, or
'm' to indicate megabytes.  Epsilon adjusts the value to make it a
multiple of 64k bytes.

Œ-ka»number… (DOS only) This switch tells Epsilon to
work around a BIOS keyboard bug present in some computers.  The
problem only shows up on a 101-key keyboard with a separate cursor
keypad, where the Alt key sometimes appears to stick after you type a
cursor key with the Alt key held down.  To test your computer for
this incompatibility, start Epsilon, type some text, and move to the
start of the buffer.  Hold down the left Alt key, then hold down the
⁄Left€ key on the separate cursor keypad.  Next, release the Alt
key.  Finally, release the ⁄Left€ key.  Now press the F key.  If
Epsilon inserts an F, your BIOS doesn't have the bug.  If the cursor
moves forward, your computer's BIOS has this bug, and you should use
the -ka flag when you start Epsilon.  Press and release the left
Alt key, and the keyboard should return to normal.

¢You can provide a number after -ka to tell Epsilon to take more
drastic steps to remedy keyboard incompatibilities.  The value 1
tells Epsilon to work around the Alt key problem described above.
The value 2 tells Epsilon to avoid a "keyboard intercept"
function that some computers don't handle correctly.  The value 4
makes Epsilon pass all keys to the BIOS.  (When you use this
option, you may find that Epsilon ignores some non-standard key
combinations like Alt-⁄Comma€.  Use the -ke flag to restore
some of these key combinations.)  The value 8 makes Epsilon try
to explicitly reset the BIOS's notion of the state of the Shift,
Ctrl, or Alt keys, whenever you release one of these keys.  The value
16 tells Epsilon to use a slower method of initializing the
mouse.  The value 32 tells Epsilon to avoid using Windows 95/98
long file name calls.

¢You can add the above -ka values together.  For example,
-ka17 works around incompatibilities in BIOS Alt key handling and
mouse support.

Œ-ka (OS/2 only) This switch enables Epsilon's advanced
OS/2 keyboard support.  Advanced keyboard support is only available
when Epsilon runs full-screen; Epsilon ignores this switch when
running in a window.  With advanced keyboard support:

 Holding down the Alt key and pressing a key on the numeric
keypad generates Alt-⁄Down€ and similar keys.  (Without advanced
keyboard support, this sequence enters keys by their ASCII codes, as
in other OS/2 programs.  The program-keys command can disable
this feature.)

 Epsilon prevents cursor run-on by adjusting the repeat rate of
repeated keys, as it does in the DOS and Windows versions.

 Epsilon recognizes the abort key faster, regardless of the
setting of the -ks flag below.

 When exiting, OS/2 will sometimes beep as Epsilon removes its
advanced keyboard support.



 F-kc, command line flagŒ-kc»number… (DOS and OS/2 only) The -kc flag
controls the mouse cursor.  The -kc2 flag provides a graphical
cursor, but only under DOS on EGA and VGA systems.  The -kc1
flag forces Epsilon to use a block cursor.  The -kc0 flag turns
off the mouse cursor entirely.  (If you run Epsilon for DOS in a
window under Microsoft Windows or OS/2 Presentation Manager, you
should provide the -kc0 or -kw flags to disable the mouse
cursor, since these environments always display their own cursors
when running a DOS application like Epsilon.)  By default, Epsilon
uses a graphical cursor if it can, and a block cursor otherwise.  You
can also set the cursor type from within Epsilon via the
mouse-graphic-cursor variable.
A non-zero value makes Epsilon use a graphical cursor.

¢When Epsilon for DOS uses a graphical mouse cursor, it must redefine
the appearance of nine characters.  By default, Epsilon uses nine
non-ASCII graphic characters, including some math symbols and some
block graphic characters.  You can use the command
¬set-display-characters to alter the reserved characters Epsilon
uses.  As you move the mouse around, the appearance of these
characters will change.  If you edit a binary file with these
characters in single-character graphic mode (where Epsilon displays
the IBM graphic characters for control and meta characters), you may
wish to use a block mouse cursor by setting
mouse-graphic-cursor to 0, or starting with the -kc1 flag.

 F-km, command line flagŒ-km»number… (DOS, Win32 Console, and OS/2 only)
The -km flag controls Epsilon's mouse use.  The -km0 flag
tells Epsilon not to use a mouse.  The -km2 flag lets Epsilon
use relative mouse coordinates.  The -km1 flag forces Epsilon to
use absolute mouse coordinates.  Relative mouse coordinates are best,
but don't work in certain windowed environments.

¢By default, Epsilon uses relative mouse coordinates.  Using absolute
mouse coordinates ensures that Epsilon's idea of the mouse cursor
location stays synchronized with the displayed mouse cursor.  The
OS/2 version of Epsilon automatically uses absolute mouse coordinates
when running in a Presentation Manager window, but the DOS version
requires the -km1 or -kw flag.  The Win32 Console version
of Epsilon only supports absolute mouse coordinates (via -km1),
or a disabled mouse (-km0).

¢With absolute mouse coordinates, Epsilon can't detect when the mouse
moves past the edge of the screen.  As a result, Epsilon won't
automatically scroll at screen edges or pop up a menu bar or a scroll
bar at the edge of the screen.  You can still use Epsilon's menu
system by turning on a permanent mouse menu with the
toggle-menu-bar command (or via the show-menu command
on Alt-F2), and you can turn on permanent screen borders to regain
the other features.  (See Rsbordersπsborders.)

 F-kp, command line flagŒ-kp (OS/2 only) This flag -kp tells Epsilon how
many seconds it should wait for a concurrent process to start, before
giving up and reporting an error.  By default, Epsilon waits 8
seconds.  Use -kp20 to make Epsilon for OS/2 wait 20 seconds.
You may find this flag useful if you use an alternate command
processor such as 4OS2.

 F-kt, command line flagŒ-kt (DOS only) Under DOS, Epsilon gets accurate timing
information by reprogramming a system timer.  The -kt flag
disables this feature, and forces Epsilon to use the less accurate
timing information provided by DOS.  When you provide this flag,
Epsilon will no longer be able to detect mouse double clicks.  (When
Epsilon for DOS runs under Windows, it gets accurate timing
information from Windows and doesn't need to reprogram a system
timer.)

Rkwflag F-kw, command line flagŒ-kw (DOS only) To run Epsilon for DOS in a
window under MS-Windows or OS/2 Presentation Manager, you must
provide the -kw flag for correct mouse behavior.  It combines
the -kc0 and -km1 flags described above.  If you
sometimes run Epsilon in a window, and sometimes full-screen, you may
wish to create two .PIF files or icons for Epsilon.  You can turn the
action of the -kw flag on or off from within Epsilon by setting
the catch-mouse≈catch-mouse variable: see Rcatchmouseπcatch-mouse.

¢With this switch, Epsilon can't detect when the mouse moves past the
edge of the screen.  As a result, Epsilon won't automatically scroll
at screen edges or pop up a menu bar or a scroll bar at the edge of
the screen.  You can still use Epsilon's menu system by turning on a
permanent mouse menu with the toggle-menu-bar command (or via
the show-menu command on Alt-F2), and you can turn on
permanent screen borders to regain the other features.  (See Rsbordersπsborders.)

Rdosvideoflags F-vclean, command line flagŒ-vclean (DOS only) On some video
boards, Epsilon must not write to the screen as fast as it can,
because doing so would result in annoying patterns on the screen,
called ªsnowº.  The -vclean switch says that the display
board in use does ªnotº suffer from this problem.  It overrides a
prior -vsnow flag (see below).

 F-vm, command line flagŒ-vm»x… (DOS only) »x… indicates, in hexadecimal,
the segment address of the beginning of your display board's memory,
if different from normal.  If Epsilon thinks you have a monochrome
adapter, it normally uses segment B000.  Otherwise, it uses segment
B800.

¢For example, if you have a display board that starts at address
A000:0, you would tell Epsilon to use that address for the display by
using the switch -vmA000.  Specify the hexadecimal
ªsegment addressº of the board, not the complete address.

snow, video F-vsnow, command line flagŒ-vsnow (DOS only) On some video boards, Epsilon must
not write to the screen as fast as it can, because doing so would
result in annoying patterns on the screen, called ªsnowº.
This switch tells Epsilon that your video board
has this problem.  Also see the -vclean switch described above.
Typically, only CGA video boards require this flag.

Rxmsflags F-x, command line flagŒ-x»bytes… (DOS only) This switch
controls Epsilon's use of extended memory, or XMS, for storing text.
»Bytes… may end with "k" to indicate kilobytes, or "m" to
indicate megabytes.  Without either suffix, Epsilon interprets a
number less than 1000 as a number of kilobytes, otherwise as a number
of bytes.  By default, Epsilon uses as much XMS memory as it needs.

¢You may specify -x0 to disable all use of XMS memory, or -x
by itself to override a prior limit (perhaps from an EPSILON
configuration variable) and put no limit on XMS memory use.

 F-xf, command line flagŒ-xf»bytes… (DOS only) This switch controls Epsilon's
use of extended memory, or XMS, for storing commands.  By default,
Epsilon loads its commands into about 80k bytes of XMS memory.  This
frees more memory for a concurrent process.  You may specify -xf0 to
make Epsilon avoid putting commands into XMS memory.
Or you may specify -xf to override a prior -x0 flag, and
permit Epsilon to use XMS memory only for commands, not buffers.

 F-xi, command line flagŒ-xi»bytes… (DOS only) By default, Epsilon tries to
allocate XMS memory in blocks of 256k bytes.  This flag sets that
allocation size.  »Bytes… may end with "k" to indicate kilobytes,
or "m" to indicate megabytes.  Without either suffix, Epsilon
interprets a number less than 1000 as a number of kilobytes,
otherwise as a number of bytes.  Epsilon adjusts the value to make it
a multiple of 64k bytes.

 F-xu, command line flagŒ-xu»bytes… (DOS only) This switch controls Epsilon's
use of memory between the 640K and 1M marks (both UMA and UMB
memory).  Normally, your system software may provide either UMA
memory or UMB memory, but not both.  This flag controls Epsilon's use
of either.

¢By default, Epsilon will try to allocate as much upper memory as it
needs.  You may specify -xu0 to make Epsilon avoid using upper
memory at all.  »Bytes… may end with "k" to indicate kilobytes, or
"m" to indicate megabytes.  Without either suffix, Epsilon interprets
a number less than 1000 as a number of kilobytes, otherwise as a
number of bytes.  Epsilon adjusts the value to make it a multiple of
4k bytes.

1General Concepts
∆General

”CgeneralThis chapter describes the framework within which the commands
operate.  The chapter entitled "Rtopicπtopic" goes into detail about every Epsilon command.

If you have never used Epsilon before, you should run the tutorial
now.  This chapter discusses some general facilities and concepts
used throughout Epsilon by many of the commands.  You will find the
discussion much clearer if you've used the tutorial, and have become
accustomed to Epsilon's general style.

To run the tutorial, start Epsilon and select Epsilon Tutorial from
the Help menu.  (You can also press the F2 key in Epsilon and type
the command name tutorial, or start Epsilon with the -teach
flag.)

2Buffer Concepts

bufferIn Epsilon's terminology, a ªbufferº contains text that you can
edit.  You can think of a buffer as Epsilon's copy of a file that you
have open for editing.  Actually, a buffer may contain a copy of a
file, or it may contain a new "file" that you've created but have
not yet saved to disk.

To edit a file, you read the file into a buffer, modify the text of
the buffer, and write the buffer to the file.  A buffer need not
necessarily correspond to a file, however.  Imagine you want to write
a short program from scratch.  You fire up Epsilon, type the text of
the program into a buffer, then save the buffer to a file.

Epsilon does not place any limitation on the number of active buffers
during an editing session.  You can edit as many buffers at the same
time as you want.  This implies that you can edit as many files, or
create as many files, or both, as you desire.  Each document or
program or file appears in its own buffer.

2Window Concepts

windowsEpsilon displays your buffers to you in ªwindowsº.  You can have
one window or many windows.  You can change the number and size of
windows at any time.  You may size a window to occupy the entire
display, or to occupy as little space as one character wide by one
character high.

Each window can display any buffer.  You decide what a window
displays.  You can always get rid of a window without worrying about
losing the information the window displays: deleting a window
does not delete the buffer it displays.

Each window displays some buffer, and several windows can
each display the same buffer.  This comes in handy if you want to look at
different parts of a buffer at the same time, say the beginning and
end of a large file.

A buffer exists whether or not it appears in some window.  Suppose
a window displays a buffer, and you decide to refer to another file.
You can read that file into the current window without disturbing
the old buffer.  You peruse the new buffer, then return to the old
buffer.

You may find this scheme quite convenient.  You have flexibility to
arrange your buffers however you like on the screen.  You can make
many windows on the screen to show any of your buffer(s), and delete
windows as appropriate to facilitate your editing.  You never have to
worry about losing your buffers by deleting or changing your windows.

Epsilon has many commands to deal with buffers and windows, such as
creating, deleting, and changing the size of windows, reading files
into a buffer, writing buffers out to files, creating and deleting
buffers, and much more.  We describe these in detail in the
chapter "Rtopicπtopic".

2Epsilon's Screen Layout

modemode linescreenbuffer, startupRscreen1To see what
buffers and windows look like, refer to the illustration.  This
shows what the screen looks like with only one window.  It shows what
the screen looks like when you edit a file named screen.1.

”Pscreen1

¿What Epsilon looks like with one window.¡

The top section of the screen displays some of the text of the
window's buffer.  Below that appears the ªmode lineº.  The mode
line shows the buffer name in parentheses, the file associated with
that buffer, if any, the current ªmodeº in square brackets (see
below), and the percentage of the buffer before the cursor.  If the
file and buffer have the same name (often the case), then the name
appears only once in the mode line.  A star (*) at the end of the
line means that you have changed the buffer since the last time you
saved it to disk.  (See Rmodeendπmode-end for information on
customizing the contents of the mode line.)  The text area and the
mode line collectively constitute the window.

echo areaBelow the mode line, on the last line of the screen, appears the
ªecho areaº.  Epsilon uses this area to prompt you for information
or to display messages (in the figure it's empty).  For example, the
command to read a file into a buffer uses the echo area to ask you
for the file name.  Regardless of how many windows you have on the
screen, the echo area always occupies the bottommost screen line.

RpointdefpointEpsilon has an important concept called the editing
point, or simply ªpointº.  While editing a buffer, the editing
point refers to the place that editing "happens", as indicated by
the cursor.  Point refers not to a character position, but rather to
a character ªboundaryº, a place ªbetweenº characters.  You can
think of point as, roughly, the leftmost edge of the cursor.
Defining the editing point as a position between characters rather
than at a particular character avoids certain ambiguities inherent in
the latter definition.

Consider, for example, the command that goes to the end of a word,
forward-word.  Since point always refers to a position between
characters, point moves right after the last letter in
the word.  So the cursor itself would appear underneath the first
character after the word.  The command that moves to the beginning of
the word, backward-word, positions point right before
the first character in the word.  In this case, the cursor itself
would appear under the first character in the word.

When you want to specify a region, this definition for point avoids
whether characters near each end belong to the region, since the ends
do not represent characters themselves, but rather character boundaries.

”Pscreen2

¿Epsilon with three windows.¡

Rscreen2The illustration shows Epsilon with 3
windows.  The top window and bottom window each show the buffer
"main".  Notice that although these two windows display the
same buffer, they show different parts of the buffer.  The mode line
of the top window says 0%, but the mode line of the bottom window
says 58%. The middle window displays a different buffer, named
"other".  If the cursor appears in the middle window and
you type regular letters (the letters of your name, for example), they
go into the buffer named "other" shown in that window.  As
you type the letters, the point (and so the cursor) stays to the
right of the letters.

current windowcurrent
bufferIn general, the ªcurrent windowº refers to the window with the
cursor, or the window where the "editing happens".  The ªcurrent
bufferº refers to the buffer displayed by the current window.

2Modes in Epsilon

modemajor modesmode, majorWhen you edit a C program, your editor should behave somewhat
differently than when you write a letter, or edit a Lisp program, or
edit some other kind of file.

For example, you might want the third function key to search forward
for a comment in the current buffer.  Naturally, what the
editor should search for depends on the programming language in
use.  In fact, you might have Pascal in the top window and C in
the bottom window.

To get the same key (in our example, the third function key) to do the
right thing in either window, Epsilon allows each buffer to have its
own interpretation of the keyboard.

We call such an interpretation a ªmodeº.  Epsilon comes with
several useful modes built in, and you can add your own using the
Epsilon Extension Language (otherwise known as EEL, pronounced like
the aquatic animal).

Epsilon uses the mode facility to provide the ªdiredº command,
which stands for "directory edit".  The dired command
displays a directory listing in a buffer, and puts
that buffer in dired mode.  Whenever the current window displays that
buffer, several special keys do things specific to dired mode.  For
example, the "e" key displays the file listed on the current line
of the directory listing, and the "n" key moves down to the next
line of the listing.  See Rdiredπdired for a full description
of dired mode.

Epsilon also provides C mode, which knows about several C indenting styles
(see Rcmodeπcmode).  We also include Fundamental mode, a
general-purpose editing mode.

Rminormodesmode, minorminor modesThe mode name that appears
in a mode line suggests the keyboard interpretation active for the
buffer displayed by that window.  When you start Epsilon with no
particular file to edit, Epsilon uses Fundamental Mode, so the word
"Fundamental" appears in the mode line.  Other words may appear
after the mode name to signal changes, often changes particular to
that buffer.  We call these ªminor modesº.  For example, the
¬auto-fill-mode command sets up a minor mode that
automatically types a ⁄Return€ for you when you type near the end
of a line.  (See Rfillingπfilling.)  It displays "Fill" in
the mode line, after the name of the major mode.  A read-only buffer
display "RO" to indicate that you won't be able to modify it.
There is always exactly one major mode in effect for a buffer, but
any number of minor modes may be active.  Epsilon lists all active
minor modes after the major mode's name.

2Binding Commands

bindingKeystrokes and Commands: BindingsRbindings
Epsilon lets you redefine the function of nearly all the keys on the
keyboard.  We call the connection between a key and the command
that runs when you type it a ªbindingº.

For example, when you type the ⁄Down€ key, Epsilon runs the
¬down-line command.  The down-line command, as the
name suggests, moves the point down by one line.  So when you type
the ⁄Down€ key, point moves down by one line.

You can change a key's binding using the ¬bind-to-key command.
The command asks for the name of a command, and for a key.
Thereafter, typing that key causes the indicated command to run.
Using bind-to-key, you could, for example, configure Epsilon
so that typing ⁄Down€ would run the forward-sentence
command instead of the down-line command.

This key-binding mechanism provides a great deal of flexibility.
Epsilon uses it even to handle the alphabetic and number keys that
appear in the buffer when you type them.  Most of the alphabetic and
number keys run the command normal-character, which simply
inserts the character that invoked it into the buffer.

EMACSOut of the box, Epsilon comes with a particular set of key bindings
that make it resemble the EMACS  text editor that runs
on many kinds of computers.  Using the key-binding mechanism and the
bind-to-key command, you could rearrange the keyboard to make
it resemble another editor's keyboard layout.  That is exactly what
the brief-keyboard command does; it rearranges the keyboard
commands to make Epsilon work like the Brief text editor.  See Rbriefkeyboardπbrief-keyboard.

Epsilon provides over 300 commands that you can bind to keys, and you
can write brand new commands to do almost anything you want, and
assign them to whatever keys you choose.  See Rbinddescrπbinddescr for more information on the bind-to-key
command.

Some commands have no default binding.  You can invoke
any command, bound or not, by giving its name.  The command
named-command, normally bound to Alt-X, prompts for a command
name and executes that command.  For example, if you type

ΩAlt-X down-lineæ

followed by pressing the ⁄Enter€ key, the cursor moves down
one line. Of course, you would find it easier in this
example to simply type the ⁄Down€ key.

2Numeric Arguments

numeric argumentargument,
numericRepeating: Numeric ArgumentsRnumargdefYou can prefix a ªnumeric argumentº, or simply an
ªargumentº, to a command.  This numeric argument generally functions
as a repeat count for that command.  You may enter a numeric argument
in several ways.  You may type Ctrl-U and then the number.  You can also
enter a numeric argument by holding down the Alt key and typing the
number using the number keys across the ªtopº of the keyboard.
Then you invoke a command, and that command generally repeats that
number of times.

For example, suppose you type the four characters Ctrl-U 2 6 Ctrl-N.  The
Ctrl-N key runs the command named down-line, which moves point
down one line.  But given a numeric argument of 26, the command moves point
down 26 lines instead of 1 line.  If you give a numeric argument of -26 by
typing a minus key while typing the 26, the down-line command
would move point ªupº 26 lines.  You
can get the same effect by holding down the Alt key and typing 26,
then typing the down-arrow key.  (Remember to release the Alt key
first; otherwise you'd get Alt-⁄Down€.)  For more information on
numeric arguments, see Rnumargdefπnumargdef.

repeating commandsYou can give a numeric argument to any Epsilon command.  Most
commands will repeat, as our example did
above.  But some commands use the numeric argument in some other way,
which can vary from command to command.  Some commands ignore the
numeric argument.  We describe all the commands in the chapter titled
"Rtopicπtopic".

2Viewing Lists

Sometimes Epsilon needs to show you a list of information.  For
example, when it asks you for the name of a file to edit, you might
request a list of possible files to edit (see the next section).  In
such cases, Epsilon will display the list of items in a pop-up
window.  While in a pop-up window, one line will stand out in a
different color (or in reverse video on a monochrome display).  If
you press ⁄Enter€, you select that item.  To select another item,
you can use normal Epsilon commands such as ⁄Up€ and ⁄Down€
to move to the next and previous items, or ⁄PageDown€ and
⁄PageUp€ to go to the next or previous windowful of items.  You
can even use Epsilon's searching commands to find the item you want.
If you don't want any item on the list, you can simply type another
response instead.

If you want to select one of the items and then edit it, press Alt-E.
Epsilon will copy the highlighted line out of the list so can edit
it.

2Completion & Defaults

completionRdefstringsWhenever Epsilon asks you for some information (for instance, the
name of a file you want to edit), you can use normal Epsilon commands
to edit your response.  For example, Control-A moves to the beginning
of the response line.  Most commands will work here, as long
as the command itself doesn't need to prompt you for more information.

At many prompts, Epsilon will automatically type a default response
for you, and highlight it.  Editing the response will remove the
highlight, while typing a new response will replace the default
response.  You can set the variable ¬insert-default-response≈insert-default-response to
zero if you don't want Epsilon to type in a response at prompts.

If you type a Control-R or Control-S, Epsilon will
type in the default text.  This is especially useful if you've told
Epsilon not to automatically insert the default response, but it can
also come in handy when you've mistakenly deleted or edited the
default response, and you want to get it back.  It's also convenient
at prompts where Epsilon doesn't automatically type the default
response, such as search prompts.  Epsilon keeps separate defaults
for the regular expression and non-regular expression replace
commands, and for the regular expression and non-regular expression
search commands.  Epsilon will never overwrite what you actually type
with a default, and indeed will only supply a default if you haven't
yet specified any input for the response.

Another way to retrieve a previous response is to type Alt-E.  While
Ctrl-R and Ctrl-S provide a "suggested response" in many commands,
Alt-E always types in exactly what you typed to that prompt last
time.  (For example, at the prompt of the write-file command,
Ctrl-S types in the name of the directory associated with the file
shown in the current window, while Alt-E types in the last file name
you typed at a write-file prompt.)  See Rhistoryπhistory.

Sometimes Epsilon shows you the default in square brackets [ ].
This means that if you just press ⁄Enter€ without entering anything,
Epsilon will use the value between the square brackets.  You can also
use the Ctrl-S key here to pull in that default value, perhaps so that you can
use regular Epsilon commands to edit the response string.

RgrabtextEpsilon can also retrieve text from the buffer at any
prompt.  Press the Alt-⁄Down€ key or Alt-Ctrl-N to grab the next
word from the buffer and insert it in your response.  Press the key
again to retrieve successive words.  This is handy if there's a file
name in the buffer that you now want to edit, for example.  The keys
Alt-⁄PageDown€ or Alt-Ctrl-V behave similarly, but retrieve from
the current position to the end of the line.

RcompletioncompletioncompletionWhenever Epsilon asks for the name of something
(like the name of a command, file, buffer, or tag), you can save
keystrokes by performing ªcompletionº on what you type.  For
example, suppose you type Alt-X to invoke a command by name, then
type the letter "v".  Only one command begins with the letter "v",
the visit-file command.  Epsilon determines that you mean the
visit-file command by examining its list of commands, and
fills in the rest of the name.  We call this process
ªcompletionº.

To use completion, type a ⁄Space€ and Epsilon will fill in as
much of the name as possible.  The letters Epsilon adds will appear
as if you had typed them yourself.  You can enter them by typing
⁄Enter€, edit them with normal editing commands, or add more
letters.  If Epsilon cannot add any letters when you ask for
completion, it will pop up a list of items that match what you've
typed so far.  To disable automatic pop-ups on completion, set the
¬completion-pops-up≈completion-pops-up variable to zero.

”Pscreen3

¿Typing "?" shows all of Epsilon's commands.¡

Rscreen3For example, four commands begin with the letters
"go", goto-beginning, goto-end, goto-line,
and goto-tag.  If you type "go", and then press
⁄Space€, Epsilon fills in "goto-" and waits for you to type
more.  Type "b" and another ⁄Space€, to see "goto-beginning".
Epsilon moves the cursor one space to the right of the last letter,
to indicate a match.  Press ⁄Enter€ to execute the
goto-beginning command.

The ⁄Esc€ key works just like the ⁄Space€ key, except that if
a single match results from the completion, Epsilon takes that as
your response.  This saves you a keystroke, but you don't have the
opportunity to check the name before continuing.  The ⁄Tab€ key
does the same thing.  However, inside a dialog under Windows, these
two keys perform their usual Windows functions of canceling the
dialog, and moving around in the dialog, respectively.  They aren't
used for completion.

Typing a question mark during completion causes Epsilon to display a
list of choices in a pop-up window. Recall that completion works with
buffer and file names, as well as with command names.  For example,
you can get a quick directory listing by giving any file command and
typing a question mark when asked for the file name.  Press the Ctrl-G
key to abort the command, when you've read the listing.  (See the
dired command in Rdiredπdired for a more general
facility.)

The illustration shows you what Epsilon looks like when you type
Alt-X (the named-command command), and then press "?" to see
a list of the possible commands.  Epsilon shows you all its commands
in a pop-up window.  Epsilon provides many more commands than could
fit in the window, so Epsilon shows you the first window-full.  At
this point, you could press ⁄Space€ or ⁄PgDn€ to see the
next window-full of commands, or use searching or other Epsilon
commands to go to the item you desire.  If you want the highlighted
item, simply press ⁄Enter€ to accept it.  If you type Alt-E,
Epsilon types in the current item and allows you to edit it.  Type
any normal character to leave the pop-up window and begin entering a
response by hand.

The illustration shows what the screen looks like if you type
"w" after the {Alt-X}, then type "?" to see the list of possible
completions.  Epsilon lists the commands that start with "w".

”Pscreen4

¿Typing "w?" shows all commands that start with "w". ¡

Rscreen4You can set variables to alter Epsilon's behavior.  The
¬menu-width≈menu-width variable contains the width of the pop-up window of
matches that Epsilon creates when you press "?". (DOS, OS/2 or Unix
only.  In Windows, drag the dialog's border to change its size.)  The
¬search-in-menu≈search-in-menu variable controls what Epsilon does when you
press "?" and then continue typing a response.  If it has a value of
zero, as it does by default, Epsilon moves from the pop-up window
back to the prompt at the bottom of the screen, and editing keys like
⁄Left€ navigate in the response.  If search-in-menu has a
nonzero value, Epsilon moves in the pop-up menu of names to the first
name that matches what you've typed, and stays in the pop-up window.
(If it can't find a match, Epsilon moves back to the prompt as
before.)

completion, excluding filesDuring file name completion, Epsilon can ignore files with certain
extensions.  The ¬ignore-file-extensions≈ignore-file-extensions variable contains a list of
extensions to ignore.  By default, this variable
has the value "|.obj|.exe|.b|.b2|.bu|", which makes file completion
ignore files that end with .obj, .exe, .b, .b2, and .bu.
Each extension must appear between "|" characters.
You can augment this list using the set-variable command,
described in Rvarsettingπvarsetting.

Similarly, the ¬only-file-extensions≈only-file-extensions variable makes
completion look only for files with certain extensions.  It
uses the same format as ignore-file-extensions, a list of
extensions surrounded by | characters.  If the variable holds a
null pointer, Epsilon uses ignore-file-extensions as above.

2Command History

command historyhistory of
commandsrecalling previous commandsRhistoryEpsilon maintains a list of
your previous responses to all prompts.  To select a prompt from the
list, press the Alt-⁄Up€ key or Alt-Ctrl-P.  Then use the arrow
keys or the mouse to choose a previous response, and press
⁄Enter€.  If you want to edit the response first, press Alt-E.

For example, when you use the grep command to search in files
for a pattern, you can press ⁄Up€ to see a list of file patterns
you've used before.  If the pattern ¥windows¥system¥*.inf appeared on the list, you could position the
cursor on it and then press Alt-E.  Epsilon would copy the
pattern out of the list so you can edit it, perhaps replacing
*.inf with *.ini.  Both patterns would then appear in the
history list next time.  Or you could just press ⁄Enter€ in the
list of previous responses to use the same pattern.

You can also use Alt-E at any prompt to retrieve the last response
without showing a list of responses first.  For example, Ctrl-X
Ctrl-F Alt-E will insert the full name of the last file you edited
with the find-file command.

2Mouse Support

dragging textmouse supportEpsilon supports a mouse under Windows, X in
Unix, DOS, and OS/2.  You can use the left button to position point,
or drag to select text.  Double-clicking selects full words.  (When a
pop-up list of choices appears on the screen, double-clicking on a
choice selects it.)  Use shift-clicking to extend or contract the
current selection by repositioning the end of the selection.  Holding
down the Alt key while selecting produces a rectangle selection.

Once you've selected a highlighted region, you
can drag it to another part of the buffer.  Move the mouse inside the
highlighted region, hold down a mouse button and move the mouse to
another part of the buffer while holding down the button.  The mouse
cursor changes to indicate that you're dragging text.  Release the
mouse button and the text will move to the new location.  To make a
copy of the text instead of moving it, hold down the Control key
while dropping the text.

Dragging text with the mouse also copies the text to a kill buffer,
just as if you had used the corresponding keyboard commands to kill
the text and yank it somewhere else.  When you drag a highlighted
rectangular region of text, Epsilon's behavior depends upon the
whether or not the buffer is in overwrite mode.  In overwrite mode,
Epsilon removes the text from its original location, replacing it
with spaces.  Then it puts the text in its new location, overwriting
whatever text might be there before.  In insert mode, Epsilon removes
the text from its original location and shifts text to its right
leftwards to fill the space it occupied.  Then it shifts text to the
right in the new location, making room for the text.

resizing windowsmoving windowsYou can use the left
button to resize windows by dragging window corners or borders.  For
pop-up windows only, dragging the title bar moves the window.

scroll barA pop-up window usually has a scroll bar on its
right border.  Drag the box or diamond up and down to scroll the
window.  Click on the arrows at the top or bottom to scroll by one
line.  Click elsewhere in the scroll bar to scroll by a page.  In
some environments, ordinary tiled windows have a scroll bar that pops
up when you move the mouse over the window's right-hand border, or
(for windows that extend to the right edge of the screen), when you
move the mouse past the right edge.  The ¬toggle-scroll-bar
command toggles whether tiled windows have pop-up scroll bars or
permanent scroll bars.

Under DOS and OS/2, you can adjust the speed at which Epsilon scrolls
due to mouse movements by setting the ¬scroll-rate≈scroll-rate variable.
It contains the number of lines to scroll per second.  The
¬scroll-init-delay≈scroll-init-delay variable contains the delay in hundredths of
a second from the time the mouse button goes down and Epsilon scrolls
the first time, to the time Epsilon begins scrolling repeatedly.

In Epsilon for Windows, the right button displays a context menu
(which you can modify by editing the file gui.mnu).  In other
versions, the right mouse button acts much like the left button, but
with a few differences: On window borders, the right button always
resizes windows, rather than scrolling or moving them.  When you
double-click with the right mouse button on a subroutine name in a
buffer in C mode, Epsilon goes to the definition of that subroutine
using the pluck-tag command (see Rtagsπtags).  To
turn off this behavior in a particular buffer, set the
buffer-specific variable ¬mouse-goes-to-tag≈mouse-goes-to-tag to zero.  To make
the right button jump to a subroutine's definition when you
double-click in any buffer, not just C mode buffers, set the default
value of this variable to one.  If you don't want C mode to
automatically set this variable nonzero, set the variable
¬c-mode-mouse-to-tag≈c-mode-mouse-to-tag to zero.

IntelliMouse supportwheel mouse buttonthird
mouse buttonmouse button, thirdYou can click (or hold) the
middle mouse button and drag the mouse to pan or auto-scroll--the
speed and direction of scrolling varies as you move the mouse.  This
works on wheeled mice like the Microsoft IntelliMouse or on any mouse
with three buttons.

Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT also recognizes wheel rolling on the
Microsoft IntelliMouse, and scrolls the current window when you roll
the wheel.  See the wheel-click-lines variable for more details.

When you run Epsilon for DOS in a window under Microsoft Windows or
in other windowed environments, you must start Epsilon with the
-kw flag for correct mouse behavior.  See Rkwflagπkwflag.

In Epsilon for Unix, selecting text normally copies it to the
clipboard, and the center mouse button normally yanks text.  See the
variables ¬mouse-selection-copies≈mouse-selection-copies and ¬mouse-center-yanks≈mouse-center-yanks.

2The Menu Bar

menu barRscreen5The Windows version of Epsilon provides a customizable menu bar and
tool bar.  To modify the menu bar, edit the file gui.mnu.  Comments
in the file describe its format.  To modify the tool bar, you can
redefine the EEL command standard-toolbar in the file menu.e.

”Pscreen5

¿Using Epsilon's menu bar. ¡

Most of the customization variables described below only apply to the
DOS, OS/2 and Unix versions of Epsilon, not the Windows version.

When you move the mouse to the very top of the
screen, Epsilon displays a pop-up menu bar.  Press and hold down the
left mouse button and highlight one of the listed commands.  Release
the mouse button and Epsilon will execute the command.  When you
invoke some commands that read additional input via the menu bar,
Epsilon automatically brings up a list of options (as if you typed
"?") so that you can select one without using the keyboard.  If you
don't want the menu bar to appear when you move the mouse to the top
of the screen, set the ¬auto-menu-bar≈auto-menu-bar variable to zero.  (You
can still bring up the menu bar from the keyboard; see below.)  You
can change the contents of the menu bar by editing the file
epsilon.mnu.  Comments in the file describe its format.  (Epsilon
stores the name of its menu file in the variable ¬menu-file≈menu-file.
Set this variable to make Epsilon use a different menu file.  During
Brief emulation, Epsilon uses the menu file brief.mnu.  Epsilon for
Windows uses the variable ¬gui-menu-file≈gui-menu-file instead.)

When you select an item on the menu bar, Epsilon flashes the selected
item.  The ¬menu-bar-flashes≈menu-bar-flashes variable holds the number of
flashes (default two).  (DOS, OS/2, Unix only.)  You can make the
menu bar permanent via the ¬toggle-menu-bar command.  It toggles
whether the menu bar always occupies an extra screen line at the top.

If you hold down the Shift or Ctrl keys while selecting a menu bar
command, Epsilon will run the command with a numeric argument of 1.
This is handy for commands that behave differently when given a
numeric argument.

You can also access the menu from the keyboard.  The command
¬show-menu on Alt-F2 brings up a menu.  Use arrow keys to move
around in it.  Press a letter to move to the next item in the menu
that begins with that letter.  Press ⁄Enter€ to execute the
highlighted item, or click on it with the mouse.  Press Ctrl-G or
⁄Esc€ to cancel.

By default, Epsilon displays key bindings for menu items.  Set the
variable ¬menu-bindings≈menu-bindings to zero to disable this feature.
Epsilon computes bindings dynamically the first time it displays a
particular menu column.  (For several commands with multiple
bindings, the epsilon.mnu file selects a particular binding to
display.)  The ¬rebuild-menu command makes Epsilon reconstruct
its menus: use this command after setting menu-bindings.

By default, when you click on the menu bar but release the mouse
without selecting a command, Epsilon leaves the menu displayed until
you click again.  Set the ¬menu-stays-after-click≈menu-stays-after-click variable to
zero if you want Epsilon to remove the menu when this happens.

1Commands by Topic
Rtopic∆Commands

”CtopicThis chapter lists all the Epsilon commands, grouped by
topic.  Each section ends with a summary of the keys, and the names
you would use to invoke the commands by name, or to rebind them to
other keys.

2Getting Help

Ctrl-_Alt-?
keyF1 keyhelp, gettingRhelpYou can get help on Epsilon by
typing F1, the ªhelp keyº.  The
help key will provide help at any time.  If you type it during
another command, ¬help simply pops up a description of that
command.  Otherwise, the help command asks you to type an
additional key to indicate what sort of help you want.  Many of these
options are also available directly from Epsilon's Help menu item, in
versions with a menu bar.

The help command actually uses various commands which you can
invoke individually.  Here are the keys you can use at the help
prompt.

Pressing A invokes the ¬apropos command, which asks for a
string, looks through the short descriptions of all the commands and
variables, then pops up a list of commands or variables (and their
descriptions) that contain the string, along with their key bindings.
Highlighted words are links to the full documentation.

Help's K option invokes the ¬describe-key command.  It
prompts for a key and provides full documentation on what that key
does.

The C option invokes the command ¬describe-command, which
provides full documentation on the command whose name you specify,
and also tells which keys invoke that command.

The B option invokes the command ¬show-bindings, which asks
for a command name and gives you the keys that run that command.

The I option invokes the command info, which starts Info
mode.  Info mode lets you read the entire Epsilon manual, as well as
any other documentation you may have in Info format.  See Rinfoπinfo.

The F option is a shortcut into Epsilon's manual in Info
mode.  It prompts for some text, then looks up that text in the index
of Epsilon's online manual.  Just press ⁄Enter€ to go to the top
of the manual.  This option invokes the command
¬epsilon-info-look-up; the command ¬epsilon-manual-info
goes to the top of Epsilon's documentation without prompting.

The Ctrl-C option prompts for the name of an Epsilon command,
then displays an Info page from Epsilon's online manual that
describes the command.

The Ctrl-K option prompts for a key, then displays an Info page
from Epsilon's online manual that describes the command it runs.

The Ctrl-V option prompts for an Epsilon variable's name, then
displays an Info page from Epsilon's online manual that describes
that variable.

The H option displays Epsilon's manual in HTML format, by running
a web browser.  It prompts for a topic, which can be a command or
variable name, or any other text.  (The browser will try to find an
exact match for what you type; if not, it will search for web pages
containing that word.)  When you're looking at Epsilon's manual in
Info mode, using one of the previous commands, this command will
default to showing the same topic in a browser.

The W option, in Epsilon for Windows, displays Epsilon's WinHelp
help file.  Like the Info-format manual, it contains the complete
text of the Epsilon manual.

The Q option invokes the command ¬what-is, which asks for a
key and tells you what command would run if you typed that key.

The R option invokes the ¬describe-variable command, which
asks for a variable name and displays the help on that variable.

The L option invokes the ¬show-last-keys command, which pops
up a window that displays the last 60 keystrokes you typed.

The M option displays help on the major mode of the current
buffer.  For example, when you're editing a C file, this command
displays help on C mode.

The V command displays Epsilon's version number and similar
information.

The ? option displays information on the help command itself,
including its options, just as typing the help key again would.

The B and Q options tell you about bindings without showing
you the associated documentation on the command.  In contrast to the
first three options, these two display their information in the echo
area, instead of popping up a window.

The ¬wall-chart command creates a table showing the commands
invoked by all the keys.  It builds a chart in a buffer named
"wall".  The wall chart includes any changes you may have made to
the normal key bindings.  You can print it and attach it to any
convenient wall using the print-buffer command.

Epsilon's help system keeps track of any changes that you make to
Epsilon.  For example, if you completely remap the keyboard,
Epsilon's help system will know about it and still give you correct
key binding information.  And Epsilon's help system will also keep
track of any commands or keyboard macros that you write and add to
Epsilon.

The ¬release-notes command reads and displays the release notes
for this version of Epsilon.

documentation, onlineedoc fileonline
documentationfile, edocSome of Epsilon's help commands use the on-line
documentation file, edoc.  This file contains
descriptions for each of Epsilon's commands and variables.  See the
description of the -fd flag in Rfdswitchπfdswitch.

Under Windows, help commands normally use the standard Windows help
file edoc.hlp to provide help.  This file contains the complete
Epsilon manual.  You can set the variable ¬want-gui-help≈want-gui-help to
zero if you want Epsilon to use its built-in help system instead of
Windows-style help whenever it can; you'll still be able to use the
¬epsilon-manual command to get Windows-style help.  The Win32
console version of Epsilon uses a similar variable
¬want-gui-help-console≈want-gui-help-console.

3Info Mode

RinfoEpsilon's Info mode lets you read documentation in Info
format.  You can press F1 i to start Info mode.  One example of
documentation available in Info format is Epsilon's manual.

An Info document is divided into nodes.  Each node describes a
specific topic.  Nodes are normally linked together into a tree
structure.

Every node has a name, which appears on the very first line of the
node.  The first line might look like this:

ΩFile: cp,  Node: Files,  Next: More Options,  Prev: Flags,  Up: Top≤æ≤
That line also indicates that the node named "More Options" comes
next after this "Files" node.  And it says which node comes before
it, and which node is its parent.  (Some nodes don't have a "Next"
or a "Prev" or an "Up" node.)  In Info mode, the keys N, P, and U
move to the current node's Next node, its Prev node, or its Up node
(its parent node).

You can scroll through a node with the usual Epsilon commands, but
Info mode also lets you use ⁄Space€ to page forward and
⁄Backspace€ to page back.  When you're at the end of a node, the
⁄Space€ key goes on to the next one, walking the tree structure
so you can read through an entire Info file.  The ⁄Backspace€ key
does the reverse; it goes to the previous node when you press it and
you're already at the top of a node.  (The keys ] and [
move ahead and back similarly, but don't page; use them when you
don't want to see any more of the current node.)

Some nodes have menus.  They look like this:

Ω  * Menu:≤≤  * Buffers::≤  * Flags::≤  * Switches: Flags.≤æ≤
Press the M key to select an item from a menu, then type the name of
the item (the part before the : character).  You can press
⁄Space€ to complete the name, or type just part of the name.  The
first two menu items let you type Buffers or Flags and go to a node with
that same name; the last item lets you type Switches but Epsilon will
go to a node named Flags.

You can also press a digit like 1, 2, 3 to go to the corresponding
node in the current node's menu.  Press 0 to go to the last node,
whatever its number.  So in the menu above, either 3 or 0 would go to
the Flags node.  Typically when you select a node from a menu, that
node's Up will lead back to the node with the menu.

A node can also have cross-references.  A cross-reference looks like
this: *Note: Command History::.  Use the F key to follow a cross
reference; it completes like M does.

Instead of typing M or F followed by a node name, you can use
⁄Tab€ and ⁄Backtab€ to move around in a node to the next or
previous menu item or cross-reference, then press ⁄Enter€ to
follow it.  Or you can double-click with the mouse to follow one.

Epsilon keeps a history of the Info nodes you've visited, so you can
retrace your steps.  Press L to go to the last Info node you were at
before this one.  Press L repeatedly to revisit earlier nodes.  When
you're done looking at Info documentation, press Q to exit Info mode.

Info documentation is tree-structured.  Normally each separate
program has its own file of documentation, and the nodes within form
a tree.  Each Info file normally has a node named "top" that's the
top node in its tree.  Then all the trees are linked together in a
directory file named "dir", which contains a menu listing all the
available files.  The T key goes to the top node in the current file.
The D key goes to the top node in the directory file.

When a node name reference contains a word in parentheses, like
(epsilon)Language Modes, it indicates the node is in a file whose
name is inside the parentheses.  (Otherwise the node must be in the
current file.)  If you omit the node name and just say (epsilon), the
Top node is implied.

When a complete path to an Info file isn't specified (as is usually
the case), Epsilon looks along an Info path.  First it looks in each
directory of the colon-separated list in the variable
¬info-path-unix≈info-path-unix (or, in non-Unix versions of Epsilon, the
semicolon-separated list in ¬info-path-non-unix≈info-path-non-unix).  These paths
may use %x to indicate the directory containing Epsilon's
executable.  If the Info file still isn't found, Epsilon tries
directories listed in any INFOPATH environment variable.

Press S to search in an Info file.  You can use the same keys as in
other Epsilon search commands to perform a regular expression search,
word search, or control case folding.  But unlike the usual searching
commands (which search only within the current node), this command
will jump from node to node if necessary to find the next match.

Press I to use an Info file's index.  I ⁄Enter€ simply moves to
the first index node in a file.  Or you can type some text, and
Epsilon will display each of the nodes in the file that have an index
entry containing that text.  Use ⁄Comma€ to advance to the next
such entry.

There are a few more Info commands.  B goes to the beginning of the
current node, like Alt-<.  > goes to the last node of the
file, viewed as a hierarchy.  G prompts for the name of a node, then
goes there.  (You can use it to reach files that might not be linked
into the Info hierarchy.)  H displays this documentation.  And
? displays a short list of Info commands.

You can navigate to Epsilon's manual using Info commands, as
explained above, but Epsilon also provides some shortcut commands.
Press F1 Ctrl-C to look up an Epsilon command's full documentation by
command name.  Press F1 Ctrl-K, then press any key and Epsilon will
show the documentation for whatever command it runs.  Press F1 Ctrl-V
to look up a variable.  Press F1 f ⁄Enter€ to go to the top of
Epsilon's documentation tree, or type a topic name before the
⁄Enter€ and Epsilon will look up that word in the index to
Epsilon's online documentation.

If you write you own Info file, Epsilon provides some commands that
help.  The ¬info-validate command checks an Info file for errors
(such as using a nonexistent node name).  The ¬info-tagify
command builds or updates an Info file's tag table.  (Info readers
like Epsilon can find nodes more quickly when a file's tag table is
up to date, so run this after you modify an Info file.)

3Web-based Epsilon Documentation

Epsilon's online manual is available in three formats:

 You can read the manual in an Epsilon buffer using Info mode by
pressing F1 f.  See Rinfoπinfo.

 Users running Microsoft Windows can access the WinHelp version
of the manual by pressing F1 w.  See Rhelpπhelp for more
information.

 You can view the HTML version of the manual using a web browser
by pressing F1 h.



To display the HTML manual, Epsilon starts a documentation server
program.  This is named lhelp.exe (or lhelpd in Unix).  The
documentation server runs in the background, hiding itself from view,
and your web browser communicates with it on a special "port", as
if it were a web server.

The documentation server must be running in order to serve
documentation, so a bookmark to a page in the documentation will only
work if the documentation server is running.  You can press F1 h in
Epsilon to ensure it's running.  To force an instance of the
documentation server to exit, invoke it again with the -q flag.

Epsilon for Unix uses a shell script named goto_url to run a
browser.  You can edit it if you prefer a different browser.  Epsilon
for Windows uses the system's default browser.

2Moving Around
3Simple Movement Commands

arrow keysmoving aroundThe most basic commands
involve moving point around.  Recall from Rpointdefπpointdef
that point refers to the place where editing happens.

The Ctrl-F command moves point forward one character, and Ctrl-B moves it
back.  Ctrl-A moves to the beginning of the line, and Ctrl-E moves to its
end.

Ctrl-N and Ctrl-P move point to the next and previous lines, respectively.
They will try to stay in the same column in the new line, but will
never expand a line in order to maintain the column; instead they
will move to the end of the line (but see below).  The key Alt-<
moves point before the first character in the buffer, and Alt->
moves point after the last character in the buffer.

You can use the arrow keys if you prefer: the ⁄Right€ key moves
forward a character, ⁄Left€ moves back a character, ⁄Down€
moves down a line, and ⁄Up€ moves up a line.  Most commands bound
to keys on the numeric keypad also have bindings on some control or
alt key for those who prefer not to use the keypad.  Throughout the
rest of this chapter, the explanatory text will only mention one of
the bindings in such cases; the other bindings will appear in the
summary at the end of each section.

Rvirtual-spaceBy default, pressing ⁄Right€ at the end of
the line moves to the start of the next line.  When you press
⁄Down€ at the end of a 60-character line, and the next line only
has 10 characters, Epsilon moves the cursor back to column 10.  You
can change this by setting the buffer-specific ¬virtual-space≈virtual-space
variable (by default zero).  If you set it to one, the ⁄Up€ and
⁄Down€ keys will stay in the same column, even if no text exists
there.  If you set it to two, in addition to ⁄Up€ and ⁄Down€,
the ⁄Right€ and ⁄Left€ keys will move into places where no
text exists.  Setting virtual-space to two only works correctly
on lines longer than the window when Epsilon has been set to scroll
long lines (the default), rather than wrapping them (see Rscrollmodeπscrollmode).  Some commands behave unexpectedly on wrapped
lines when virtual-space is two.

When you move past the bottom or top of the screen using ⁄Up€ or
⁄Down€, Epsilon scrolls the window by one line, so that point
remains at the edge of the window.  If you set the variable
¬scroll-at-end≈scroll-at-end (normally 1) to a positive number, Epsilon will
scroll by that many lines when ⁄Up€ or ⁄Down€ would leave the
window.  Set the variable to 0 if you want Epsilon to instead center
the current line in the window.

3Moving in Larger Units
4Words

word commandsRwordcmdsEpsilon has several commands
that operate on words.  A word usually consists of a sequence of
letters, numbers, and underscores.  The Alt-F and Alt-B commands move
forward and backward by words, and the Alt-D and
Alt-⁄Backspace€ commands kill forward and backward by words,
respectively.  Like all killing commands, they save away what they
erase (see Rkilldefπkilldef for a discussion on the killing
commands).  Epsilon's word commands work by moving in the appropriate
direction until they encounter a word edge.

The word commands use a regular expression to define the current
notion of a word.  They use the buffer-specific variable
¬word-pattern≈word-pattern.  This allows different modes to have different
notions of what constitutes a word.  Most built-in modes, however,
make word-pattern refer to the variable ¬default-word≈default-word,
which you can modify.  (Epsilon for DOS and Epsilon for OS/2 use
¬default-oem-word≈default-oem-word instead of default-word, since they use a
font with a different set of accented characters.)  See Rregexπregex for information on regular expressions, and Rvarsettingπvarsetting for information on setting this variable.

4Sentences

 KAlt-K KCtrl-⁄Up€ KAlt-A KCtrl-⁄Down€ KAlt-Esentence commandsFor sentences, Epsilon has the Alt-E and
Alt-A keys, which move forward and backward by sentences, and the
Alt-K key, which deletes forward to the end of the current sentence.
A sentence ends with one of the characters period, !, or ?, followed
by any number of the characters ", ', ), ], followed by two
spaces or a newline.  A sentence also ends at the end of a paragraph.
The next section describes Epsilon's notion of a paragraph.

4Paragraphs

paragraphsFor paragraphs, the keys Alt-] and Alt-[ move
forward and back, and the key Alt-H puts point and mark around the
current paragraph.  Blank lines (containing only spaces and tabs)
always separate paragraphs, and so does the form-feed character ^L.

You can control what Epsilon considers a paragraph using
two variables.

If the buffer-specific variable ¬indents-separate-paragraphs≈indents-separate-paragraphs has a
nonzero value, then a paragraph also begins with a nonblank line
that starts with a tab or a space.

If the buffer-specific variable ¬tex-paragraphs≈tex-paragraphs has a nonzero
value, then Epsilon will not consider as part of a paragraph any
sequence of lines that each start with at sign or period, if that
sequence appears next to a blank line.  And lines starting with
¥begin or ¥end or % will also delimit paragraphs.

4Parenthetic Expressions

levellisp commandsbrace matchingbracket matchingparenthesis matching

Epsilon has commands to deal with matching parentheses,
square brackets, and curly braces.  We call a pair of these characters with
text between them a ªlevelº.  You can use these level commands to
manipulate expressions in many programming languages,
such as Lisp, C, and Epsilon's own embedded programming language,
EEL.

A level can contain other levels, and Epsilon won't get confused by
the inner levels.  For example, in the text "one (two (three) four)
five" the string "(two (three) four)" constitutes a level.
Epsilon recognizes that "(three)" also constitutes a level, and so
avoids the mistake of perhaps calling "(two (three)" a level.  In
each level, the text inside the delimiters must contain matched pairs
of that delimiter.  In C mode, Epsilon knows to ignore delimiters
inside strings or comments, when appropriate.

Epsilon recognizes the following pairs of enclosures: "(" and
")", "[" and "]", "{" and "}".  The command Ctrl-Alt-F
moves forward to the end of the next level, by looking forward until
it sees the start of a level, and moving to its end.  The command
Ctrl-Alt-B moves backward by looking back for the end of a level and going
to its beginning.  The Ctrl-Alt-K command kills the next level by moving
over text like Ctrl-Alt-F and killing as it travels, and the Alt-⁄Del€
command moves backward like Ctrl-Alt-B and kills as it travels.

The Alt-) key runs the ¬find-delimiter command.  Use it to
temporarily display a matching delimiter.  The command moves backward
like Ctrl-Alt-B and pauses for a moment, showing the screen, then
restores the screen as before.  The pause normally lasts one half of
a second, or one second if the command must temporarily reposition
the window to show the matching delimiter.  You can specify the
number of hundredths of a second to pause by setting the variables
¬near-pause≈near-pause and ¬far-pause≈far-pause.  Also, typing any key will
immediately restore the original window context, without further
pause.

The ¬show-matching-delimiter command inserts the key
that invoked it by calling ¬normal-character and then invokes
find-delimiter to show its match.  Some people like
to bind the ")", "]" and "∂" keys to
¬show-matching-delimiter.

In some modes, when the cursor is over a delimiter Epsilon will
automatically seek out its matching delimiter and highlight them
both.  See the descriptions of C, TeX, and HTML modes for more
information.

3Searching

searching, for special
characterscontrol chars, in searchesregular expressionssearching, regular
expressionsearching, incrementalRincrementalsearch
Epsilon provides a set of flexible searching commands that
incorporate ªincremental searchº.  In the ¬incremental-search
command, Epsilon searches as you type the search string.  Ctrl-S begins
an incremental search forward, and Ctrl-R starts one in reverse.  Any
character that normally inserts itself into the buffer becomes part
of the search string.  In an incremental search, Ctrl-S and Ctrl-R find the
next occurrence of the string in the forward and reverse directions,
respectively. With an empty search string, Ctrl-S or Ctrl-R will
either reverse the direction of the search, or bring in the
previously used search string.  (To retrieve older search strings,
see Rhistoryπhistory.)

quoting special chars in searchesYou can use ⁄Backspace€ to remove characters from the
search string, and enter control characters and ªmeta charactersº
(characters with the eighth bit set) in the search string by quoting
them with Ctrl-Q. (Type
Ctrl-Q Ctrl-J to search for a ⁄Newline€ character.)  Use the
Ctrl-G ¬abort command to stop a long search in progress.

Typing ⁄Enter€ or ⁄Esc€ exits from an incremental search,
makes Epsilon remember the search string, and leaves point at the
match in the buffer.

While typing characters into the search string for
¬incremental-search, a Ctrl-G quits and moves point back to the
place the search started, without changing the default search string.
During a failing search, however, Ctrl-G simply removes the part of the
string that did not match.

If you type an editing key not mentioned in this section, Epsilon
exits the incremental search, then executes the command bound to the
key.

You can make Epsilon copy search text from the current buffer by
typing Alt-⁄Down€.  Epsilon will append the next word from the
buffer to the current search string.  This is especially convenient
when you see a long variable name, and you want to search for other
references to it.  (It's similar to setting the mark and moving
forward one word with Alt-F, then copying the text to a kill buffer
and yanking it into the current search string.)  Similarly,
Alt-⁄PageDown€ appends the next line from the current buffer to
the search string.  These two keys are actually available at almost
any Epsilon prompt, though they're especially useful when searching.
Alt-Ctrl-N and Alt-Ctrl-V are synonyms for Alt-⁄Down€ and
Alt-⁄PageDown€, respectively.

You can change how Epsilon interprets the search string by pressing
certain keys when you type in the search string.  Pressing the key a
second time restores the original interpretation of the search
string.


searching, case foldingRsearch-subcommandsPressing Ctrl-C toggles the state of ªcase
foldingº.  While case folding, Epsilon considers upper case and lower
case the same when searching, so a search string of "Word" would
match "word" and "WORD" as well.

°Epsilon remembers the state of case folding for each buffer
separately, using the buffer-specific variable ¬case-fold≈case-fold.
When you start to search, Epsilon sets its default for case folding
based on that variable's value for the current buffer.  Toggling case
folding with Ctrl-C won't affect the default.  Use the
¬set-variable command described in Rvarsettingπvarsetting
to do this.

 word searchingsearching, for wordsPressing Ctrl-W toggles ªword searchingº.
During word searching, Epsilon only
looks for matches consisting of complete words.  For instance, word
searching for "a" in this paragraph finds only one match (the
one in quotes), but eleven when not doing word searching.

 searching, regular expressionPressing Ctrl-T makes
Epsilon interpret the search string as a regular expression search
pattern, as described in Rregexπregex.  Another Ctrl-T turns off
this interpretation.  If the current search string denotes an invalid regular
expression, Epsilon displays "Bad R-E Search: <string>"
instead of its usual message "R-E Search: <string>" (where
<string> refers to the search string).

 searching, incremental modePressing Ctrl-O toggles
incremental searching.  In an incremental search, most editing
commands will exit the search, as described above.  But you may want
to edit the search string itself.  If you turn off the
"incremental" part of incremental search with the Ctrl-O key, Epsilon
will let you use the normal editing keys to modify the search string.

°In non-incremental mode, Epsilon won't automatically search after you
type each character, but you can tell it to find the next match by
typing Ctrl-S or Ctrl-R (depending on the direction).  This performs
the search but leaves you in search mode, so you can find the next
occurrence of the search string by typing Ctrl-S or Ctrl-R again.
When you press ⁄Enter€ to exit from the search, Epsilon will
search for the string you've entered, unless you've just searched
with Ctrl-S or Ctrl-R.  (In general, the ⁄Enter€ key causes a
search if the cursor appears in the echo area.  If, on the other
hand, the cursor appears in a window showing you a successful search,
then typing the ⁄Enter€ key simply stops the search.)  A numeric
argument of »n… to a non-incremental search will force Epsilon
to find the »n…th occurrence of the indicated string.



Epsilon interprets the first character you type after starting a
search with Ctrl-S or Ctrl-R a little differently.  Normally, Ctrl-S starts an
incremental search, with regular expression searching and word
searching both disabled.  If you type Ctrl-T or Ctrl-W to turn one of these
modes on, Epsilon will also turn off incremental searching.
Epsilon also pulls in a default search string differently if you do
it immediately.  It will always provide the search string from the
last search, interpreting the string as it did for that search.
If you retrieve a default search string at any other time, Epsilon
will provide the last one consistent with the state of regular
expression mode (in other words, the last regular expression pattern,
if in regular expression mode, or the last
non-regular-expression string otherwise).

searching, conventionalThe Ctrl-Alt-S and Ctrl-Alt-R commands function like Ctrl-S and
Ctrl-R, but they start in regular-expression, non-incremental mode.
You can also start a plain string search in non-incremental mode
using the ¬string-search and ¬reverse-string-search
commands.  Some  people like to
bind these commands to Ctrl-S and Ctrl-R, respectively.

Keep in mind that you can get from any type of search to any other
type of search by typing the appropriate subcommands to a search.
For example, if you meant to do a regex-search but instead
typed Ctrl-S to do an incremental search, you could enter regex mode by
typing Ctrl-T.  The table summarizes the search subcommands.

ŒCtrl-S or Ctrl-RSwitch to a new direction, or find the next occurrence
in the same direction, or pull in the previous search string.

Œnormal keyAdd that character to the search string.

Œ⁄Backspace€Remove the last character from the search string.

ŒCtrl-GStop a running search, or (in incremental mode) delete
characters until the search succeeds, or abort the search, returning
to the starting point.

ŒCtrl-OToggle incremental searching.

ŒCtrl-TToggle regular expression searching.

ŒCtrl-WToggle word searching.  Matches must consist of complete words.

ŒCtrl-CToggle case folding.

Œ⁄Enter€Exit the search.

ŒCtrl-QQuote the following key, entering it into the search string even
if it would normally run a command.

Œhelp keyShow the list of search subcommands.

Œother keysIf in incremental mode, exit the search, then execute
the key normally.  If not incremental mode, edit the search string.

¿The search subcommands work in all search and replace commands.¡

Rsmodeswrapping during searchesWhen you're at the last match of some
text in a buffer, and tell incremental search to search again by
pressing Ctrl-S, Epsilon displays "Failing" to indicate no more
matches.  If you press Ctrl-S once more, Epsilon will wrap to the
beginning of the buffer and continue searching from there.  It will
display "Wrapped" to indicate it's done this.  If you keep on
search, eventually you'll pass your starting point again; then
Epsilon will display "Overwrapped" to indicate that it's showing
you a match you've already seen.  A reverse search works similarly;
Epsilon will wrap to the end of the buffer when you keep searching
after a search has failed.  (You can set the ¬search-wraps≈search-wraps
variable to zero to disable wrapping.)

The ¬forward-search-again and ¬reverse-search-again
commands search forward and backward (respectively) for the
last-searched-for search string, without prompting.  The
¬search-again command searches in the same direction as before
for the same search string.

Rfwd-search-keyYou can change the function of most keys in
Epsilon by rebinding them (see Rbinddescrπbinddescr).  But
Epsilon doesn't implement the searching command keys listed above
with the normal binding mechanism.  The EEL code for searching refers
directly to the keys Ctrl-C, Ctrl-W, Ctrl-T, Ctrl-O, Ctrl-Q,
⁄Enter€, and ⁄Esc€, so to change the function of these keys
within searching you must modify the EEL code in the file search.e.
Epsilon looks at your current bindings to determine which keys to use
as the help key and backspace key.  It looks at the abort_key≈abort_key
variable to determine what to use as your abort key, instead of
Ctrl-G.  (See Rabortcmdπabortcmd.)  Epsilon always recognizes
Ctrl-S and Ctrl-R as direction keys, but you can set two variables
¬fwd-search-key≈fwd-search-key and ¬rev-search-key≈rev-search-key to key codes.  These
will then act as "synonyms" to Ctrl-S and Ctrl-R, respectively.

When you select a searching command from the menu or tool bar (rather
than via a command's keyboard binding), Epsilon for Windows runs the
¬dialog-search or ¬dialog-reverse-search command, to
display a search dialog.  Most of the keys described above also work
in dialog-based searching.

4Searching Multiple Files

searching multiple filesRgrep-cmdEpsilon provides a
convenient grep command that lets you search a set of files.
The command prompts you for a search string (all of the search
options described above apply) and for a file pattern.  By default,
the grep interprets the search string as a regular expression
(see Rregexπregex).  To toggle regular expression mode, press
Ctrl-T at any time while typing the search string.  The command then
scans the indicated files, puts a list of matching lines in the grep
buffer, then displays the grep buffer in the current window.  Each
line indicates the file it came from.

With a numeric argument, this command searches through buffers
instead of files.  Instead of prompting for a file name pattern,
Epsilon prompts for a buffer name pattern, and only operates on those
buffers whose names match that pattern.  Buffer name patterns use a
simplified file name pattern syntax: * matches zero or more
characters, ? matches any single character, and character classes
like [a-z] may be used too.

When grep prompts for a file pattern, it shows you the last file
pattern you searched inside square brackets.  You can press
⁄Enter€ to conveniently search through the same files again.  To
get the path to the current buffer, so you can easily search through
files in the same directory, press Ctrl-S or Ctrl-R.  To repeat a
file pattern from before, press ⁄Up€ or Ctrl-P.  (See Rhistoryπhistory for details.)  You can use extended file patterns
to search in multiple directories; see Rwildcardsπwildcards.

In a grep buffer, you can move around by using the normal movement
commands.  Most alphabetic keys run special grep commands.  The "N"
and "P" keys move to the next and previous entries.

You can easily go from the grep buffer to the corresponding locations
in the original files.  To do this, simply position point on the copy
of the line, then press ⁄Space€, ⁄Enter€, or "E".  The file
appears in the current window, with point positioned at the beginning
of the matching line.  Typing "1" brings up the file in a window that
occupies the entire screen.  Typing "2" splits the window horizontally,
then brings up the file in the lower window.  Typing "5" splits the
window vertically, then brings up the file.  Typing "Z" runs
the zoom-window command, then brings up the file.

When Epsilon wants to search a particular file as a result of
a grep command, it first scans the buffers to see if one
of them contains the given file.  If so, it uses that buffer.
If the file doesn't appear in any buffer, Epsilon reads the file
into a temporary buffer, does the search, then discards the buffer.

If you want Epsilon to always keep the files around in such cases,
set the variable ¬grep-keeps-files≈grep-keeps-files to a nonzero value.  In that
case, grep will simply use the find-file command to
get any file it needs to search.

By default, each invocation of grep appends its results
to the grep buffer.  If you set the variable ¬grep-empties-buffer≈grep-empties-buffer
to a nonzero value, grep will clear the grep buffer
at the start of each invocation.

You can move from match to match without returning to the grep
buffer.  The Ctrl-X Ctrl-N command moves directly to the next match.  It
does the same thing as switching to the grep buffer, moving down one
line, then pressing ⁄Space€ to select that match.  Similarly, Ctrl-X
Ctrl-P backs up to the previous match.

Actually, Ctrl-X Ctrl-N runs the ¬next-position command.  After a
grep command, this command simply calls next-match,
which moves to the next match as described above.  If you run a
compiler in a subprocess, however, next-position calls
next-error instead, to move to the next compiler error
message.  If you use the grep command again, or press
⁄Space€ in the grep buffer to select a match, or run
next-match explicitly, then next-position will again
call next-match to move to the next match.

Similarly, Ctrl-X Ctrl-P actually runs ¬previous-position, which
calls either previous-error or previous-match,
depending upon whether you last ran a compiler or searched across
files.

3Bookmarks

setting bookmarksbookmarksEpsilon's bookmark commands
let you store the current editing position, so that you can easily
return to it later.  To drop a bookmark at point, use the Alt-/ key.
For each bookmark, Epsilon remembers the buffer and the place within
that buffer.  Later, when you want to jump to that place, press
Alt-J.  Epsilon remembers the last 10 bookmarks that you set with
Alt-/.  To cycle through the last 10 bookmarks, you can press Alt-J and
keep pressing it until you arrive at the desired bookmark.

You can set a named bookmark with the Ctrl-X / key.  The command prompts
you for a letter, then associates the current buffer and position
with that letter.  To jump to a named bookmark, use the Ctrl-X J key.
It prompts you for the letter, then jumps to that bookmark.

Instead of a letter, you can specify a digit (0 to 9).  In that case,
the number refers to one of the temporary bookmarks that you set with
the Alt-/ key.  Zero refers to the last temporary bookmark, 1 to the
one before that, and so on.

Whenever one of these commands asks you to specify a character for a
bookmark, you can get a list by pressing "?".  Epsilon then pops up a
list of the bookmarks you've defined, along with a copy of the line
that contains the bookmark.  You can simply move to one of the lines
and press ⁄Enter€ to select that bookmark.  In a list of
bookmarks, press D to delete the highlighted bookmark.

The command ¬list-bookmarks works like the Ctrl-X J key, but
automatically pops up the list of bookmarks to choose from.  If you
like, you can bind it to Ctrl-X J to get that behavior.

3Tags

tagging function namesRtagsEpsilon provides a facility
to remember which file defines a particular subroutine or procedure.
This can come in handy if your program consists of several source
files.  Epsilon can remember this kind of information for you by
using "tags".  A tag instructs Epsilon to look for a particular
function at a certain position in a certain file.

The ¬goto-tag command on Ctrl-X ⁄Period€ prompts for the name
of a function and jumps immediately to the definition of the routine.
You can use completion (see Rcompletionπcompletion) while typing
the tag name, or press "?" to select from a list of tags.  (Epsilon
also shows the defining file of each tag.)

If you don't give a name, goto-tag goes to the next tag with
the same name as the last tag you gave it.  If the same tag occurs
several times (for example, if you tag several separate files that
each define a main() function), use this to get to the other tag
references, or press "?" after typing the tag name to select the
correct file from a list.  If you give goto-tag a numeric
argument, it goes to the next tag without even asking for a name.
When there are several instances of a single tag, you can also use
Ctrl-⁄NumPlus€ and Ctrl-⁄NumMinus€ to move among them.

The ¬pluck-tag command on Ctrl-X ⁄Comma€ first retrieves
the routine name adjacent to or to the right of point, then jumps to
that routine's definition.

If the file containing the definition appears in a window already,
Epsilon will change to that window.  Otherwise, Epsilon uses the
¬find-file command to read the file into a buffer.  Then
Epsilon jumps to the definition, positioning its first line near the
top of the window.  You can set the window line to receive the first
line of the definition via the ¬show-tag-line≈show-tag-line variable.  It
says how many lines down the definition should go.

Before Epsilon moves to the tag, it sets a temporary bookmark at your
old position, just like the set-bookmark command on Alt-/.
After goto-tag or pluck-tag, press Alt-J or
Ctrl-⁄NumStar€ to move back to your previous position.

Normally, you have to tell Epsilon beforehand which files to look
in.  The ¬tag-files command on Ctrl-X Alt-⁄Period€ prompts
for a file name or file pattern such as *.c and makes a tag for each
routine in the file.  It knows how to recognize routines in C, C++,
Java, Perl and EEL programs as well as assembly programs.  (Using
EEL, you can teach Epsilon to tag other languages too.  See Reeltagsπeeltags.)  If you tag a previously tagged file, the new
tags replace all the old tags for that file.  You can use extended
file patterns to tag files in multiple directories; see Rwildcardsπwildcards.  When Epsilon can't find a tag, it tries
retagging the current file before giving up; that means if your
program is confined to one file, you don't have to tag it first.  Set
¬tag-ask-before-retagging≈tag-ask-before-retagging nonzero if you want Epsilon to ask
first.

 E#define, preprocessor commandIn Perl, Epsilon tags subroutine definitions.  In C, C++, Java and
EEL, tag-files normally tags subroutine and variable
definitions, typedef definitions, structure and union member and tag
definitions, and #define constants.  But it doesn't tag
declarations (variables that use extern, function declarations
without a body).  With a numeric prefix argument, Epsilon includes
these too.  (Typically you'd do this for header files when you don't
have source code for the function definitions--system files and
library files, for instance.)

You can also set up tag-files to include declarations by
default, by setting the ¬tag-declarations≈tag-declarations variable.  If zero
(the default), tag-files only tags definitions.  If one,
Epsilon tags function declarations as well.  If two, Epsilon tags
variable declarations (which use the extern keyword).  If three,
Epsilon tags both types of declarations.  Using a prefix argument
with tag-files temporarily sets tag-declarations to
three, so it tags everything it can.

You can set ¬tag-case-sensitive≈tag-case-sensitive nonzero if you want tagging to
consider MAIN, Main and main to be distinct tags.  By default, typing
main will find any of these.

Epsilon can maintain separate groups of tags, each in a separate file.
The ¬select-tag-file command on Ctrl-X Alt-⁄Comma€
prompts for the name of a tag file, and uses that file for tag
definitions.

When Epsilon needs to find a tag file, it searches for a file
in the current directory, then in its parent directory,
then in that directory's parent, and so forth, until it reaches the
root directory or finds a file "default.tag".  If Epsilon finds no
file with that name, it creates a new tag file in the
current directory.  To force Epsilon to create a new tag file in the
current directory, even if a tag file exists in a parent directory,
use the ¬select-tag-file command.

You can set the variable ¬initial-tag-file≈initial-tag-file to a relative
pathname like "myfile.tag", if you want Epsilon to search for that
file, or you can set it to an absolute pathname if you want
Epsilon to use the same tag file no matter which directory you use.

.BSC files for taggingbrowser files for taggingThe
tag system can also use .BSC files from Microsoft Visual C++
4.1 and later.  Epsilon requires a Microsoft Browser Toolkit DLL to do
this.  We have not received permission to redistribute this DLL from
Microsoft, but you can download it from their web site at <http://www.microsoft.com/kb/articles/q153/3/93.htm>, or
from an MSDN library disk (search for Knowledge Base article Q153393
or the older Q94375).

If you use Visual 4.1 or 4.2, download the archive BSCKIT41.EXE and
extract the file bsc41.dll.  If you use Visual C 5.0, download the
archive BSCKIT50.EXE and extract the file msbsc50.dll.  If you use
Visual C 6.0, download the archive BSCKIT60.EXE and extract the file
msbsc60.dll.  With any of these DLL files, rename it to bsc.dll and
place it in the directory containing Epsilon's executable (for
example c:¥Program Files¥Epsilon¥Bin).  Then use
the select-tag-file command on Ctrl-X Alt-⁄Comma€ to
select your .BSC file.

When Epsilon uses a .BSC file, the commands tag-files,
clear-tags, sort-tags, and the variables
tag-case-sensitive, tag-relative, want-sorted-tags,
and tag-by-text do not apply.  See Microsoft compiler
documentation for information on generating .BSC and .SBR files.

The ¬retag-files command makes Epsilon rescan all the files
represented in the current tag file and generate a new set of tags
for each, replacing any prior tags.  The ¬clear-tags command
makes Epsilon forget about all the tags in the current tag file.  The
untag-files command displays a list of all files mentioned in
the current tag file; you can edit the list by deleting any file
names that shouldn't be included, and when you press Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z,
Epsilon will forget all tags that refer to the file names you deleted.

When Epsilon records a tag, it stores the character position and the
text of the line at the tag position.  If the tag doesn't appear at
the remembered character offset, Epsilon searches for the defining
line.  And if that doesn't work (perhaps because its defining line
has changed) Epsilon retags the file and tries again.  This means
that once you tag a file, it should rarely prove necessary to retag
it, even if you edit the file.  To save space in the tag file, you
can have Epsilon record only the character offset, by setting the
variable ¬tag-by-text≈tag-by-text to zero.  Because this makes Epsilon's
tagging mechanism faster, it's a good idea to turn off
tag-by-text before tagging any very large set of files that
rarely changes.

By default, Epsilon sorts the tag list whenever it needs to display a
list of tag names for you to choose from.  Although Epsilon tries to
minimize the time taken to sort this list, you may find it
objectionable if you have many tags.  Instead, you can set the
¬want-sorted-tags≈want-sorted-tags variable to 0, and sort the tags manually,
whenever you want, using the ¬sort-tags command.

Epsilon normally stores file names in its tag file in relative
format, when possible.  This means if you rename or copy a directory
that contains some source files and a tag file for them, the tag file
will still work fine.  If you set the variable ¬tag-relative≈tag-relative to
0, Epsilon will record each file name with an absolute pathname

3Comparing

RcompareThe ¬compare-windows command on Ctrl-F2 finds
differences between the contents of the current buffer and that
displayed in the next window on the screen.  If called while in the
last window, it compares that window with the first window.  The
comparison begins at point in each window.  Epsilon finds the first
difference between the buffers and moves the point to just before the
differing characters, or to the ends of the buffers if it finds no
difference.  It then displays a message in the echo area reporting
whether or not it found a difference.

If you invoke compare-windows again immediately after it has found
a difference, the command will try to resynchronize the windows by moving
forward in each window until it finds a match of at least
¬resynch-match-chars≈resynch-match-chars characters.  It doesn't necessarily move
each window by the same amount, but instead finds a match that
minimizes the movement in the window that it moves the most.  It then
reports the number of characters in each window it skipped past.

Normally compare-windows treats one run of space and tab
characters the same as any other run, so it skips over differences in
horizontal whitespace.  You can set the
¬compare-windows-ignores-space≈compare-windows-ignores-space variable to change this.

RdiffcmdThe ¬diff command works like
compare-windows, but it will compare and
resynchronize over and over from the beginning to the end of each
buffer, producing a report that lists all differences between the two
buffers.  It operates line-by-line rather than character-by-character.

When resynchronizing, diff believes it has found another
match when ¬diff-match-lines≈diff-match-lines lines in a row match, and gives up
if it cannot find a match within ¬diff-mismatch-lines≈diff-mismatch-lines lines.
By default, diff resynchronizes when it encounters three
lines in a row that match, and gives up after finding no matches
starting in the next thirty lines of each buffer.

The diff command reports each difference with a summary line
and then the text of the differing lines.  The summary line
consists of two line number ranges with a letter between them
indicating the type of change: "a" indicates lines to
add to the first buffer to match the second, "d" indicates lines
to delete, and "c" indicates lines to change.
For example, a summary line in the diff listing
of "20,30c23,29" means to remove lines 20 through 30 from the first
buffer and replace them with a copy of lines 23 through 29 from the
second buffer.  "11a12" means that
adding line 12 from the second buffer right after line 11 in the
first buffer would make them identical.  "11,13d10" means that
deleting lines 11, 12 and 13 from the first buffer (which would
appear just after line 10 in the second) would make them identical.

After each summary line, diff puts the lines to which the
summary refers.  The diff command prefixes lines to delete
from the first buffer by "<" and lines to add by ">".

The ¬visual-diff command is like diff but uses colors to
show differences.  It constructs a new buffer that contains all the
lines of the two buffers.  Lines from the first buffer that don't
appear in the second are displayed with a red background.  Lines in
the second buffer that don't appear in the first have a yellow
background.  Lines that are the same in both buffers are colored
normally.  In a visual-diff buffer, the keys Alt-⁄Down€ and Alt-]
move to the start of the next changed or common section.  The keys
Alt-⁄Up€ and Alt-[ move to the previous change or common section.

The ¬merge-diff command is another variation on diff
that's useful with buffers in C mode.  It marks differences by
surrounding them with #ifdef preprocessor lines, first prompting for
the #ifdef variable name to use.  The resulting buffer receives the
mode and settings of the first of the original buffers.  The marking
is mechanical, and doesn't parse the text being marked off, so it may
produce invalid code.  For example, if an #if statement differs
between the two buffers, the result will contain improperly nested
#if statements like this:

Ω#ifndef DIFFVAR≤     #if DOSVERSION≤#else // DIFFVAR≤     #if MSDOSVERSION≤#endif // DIFFVAR≤æ≤
Therefore, you should examine the output of merge-diff before
trying to compile it.

Like compare-windows and diff, the
¬compare-sorted-windows command compares the contents of the
current buffer with that displayed in the next window on the screen.
Use it when you have (for example) two lists of variable names, and
you want to find out which variables appear on only one or the other
list, and which appear on both.  This command assumes that you sorted
both the buffers.  It copies all lines appearing
in both buffers to a buffer named "inboth".  It copies all lines
that appear only in the first buffer to a buffer named "only1", and
lines that appear only in the second to a buffer named "only2".

The ¬uniq command goes through the current buffer and looks for
adjacent identical lines, deleting the duplicate copies of each
repeated line and leaving just one.  It doesn't modify any lines that
only occur once.  This command behaves the same as the Unix command of
the same name.

The ¬keep-unique-lines command deletes all copies of any duplicated
lines.  This command acts like the Unix command "uniq -u".

The ¬keep-duplicate-lines command deletes all lines that only
occur once, and leaves one copy of each duplicated line.  This
command acts like the Unix command "uniq -d".

The following table shows how sample text would be modified by each
of the above commands.

2Changing Text
3Inserting and Deleting

inserting charactersWhen you type most alphabetic or numeric
keys, they appear in the buffer before point.  Typing one of these
keys runs the command ¬normal-character, which simply inserts
the character that invoked it into the buffer.

When you type a character bound to the normal-character
command, Epsilon inserts the character before point, so that the
cursor moves forward as you type characters.  Epsilon can also
overwrite as you type.  The ¬overwrite-mode command, bound to
the ⁄Ins€ key, toggles overwriting for the current buffer.  If
you give it a nonzero numeric argument (for example, by typing Ctrl-U
before invoking the command, see Rnumargdefπnumargdef), it
doesn't toggle overwriting, but turns it on.  Similarly, a numeric
argument of zero always turns off overwriting.  Overwriting will
occur for all characters except newline, and overwriting never occurs
at the end of a line.  In these cases the usual insertion will
happen.  The buffer-specific variable ¬over-mode≈over-mode controls
overwriting.

The Ctrl-Q key inserts special characters, such as control characters,
into the current buffer.  It waits for you to type a character, then
inserts it.  This command ignores non-ASCII keys.  If you "quote"
an Alt key in this way, Epsilon inserts the corresponding character
with its high bit on.  You can use this command for inserting
characters like Ctrl-Z that would normally execute a command when
typed.

Rinsert-asciiSometimes you may want to insert a character whose ASCII value
you know, but you may not know which keystroke that character
corresponds to.  Epsilon provides an ¬insert-ascii command
on Alt-# for this purpose.  It prompts you for a numeric value, then
inserts the ASCII character with that value into the buffer.
By default, the command interprets the value in base 10.  You can
specify a hexadecimal value by prefixing the characters "0x" to the
number, or an octal value by prefixing the character "0o" to the
number, or a binary value by prefixing "0b".  For example, the
numbers "87", "0x57", "0o127", and "0b1010111" all refer to
the same number (four score and seven), and they all would insert a
"W" character if given to the insert-ascii command.

Under DOS and OS/2, you can type graphics characters by holding down
the Alt key and typing the character's value on the numeric keypad,
assuming you've enabled these keys with the ¬program-keys
command, described in Rprogkeysπprog-keys.  Epsilon will
automatically quote the character so that it's inserted in the buffer
and not interpreted as a command.  Windows and Unix versions of
Epsilon don't require any special preparation before you can enter
characters with the numeric keypad.

The Ctrl-O command inserts a newline after point (or, to put it another
way, inserts a newline before point as usual, then backs up over it).
Use this command to break a line when you want to insert new text in
the middle, or to "open" up some space after point.

The ⁄Backspace€ key deletes the character before point, and the
⁄Del€ key deletes the character after point.  In other words,
⁄Backspace€ deletes backwards, and ⁄Del€ deletes forwards.
These commands usually do not save deleted characters in the kill
ring (see the next section).

If you prefix these commands with a numeric argument of ªnº, they
will delete ªnº characters instead of one.  In that case, you can
retrieve the deleted text from the kill ring with the Ctrl-Y key (see
the next section).

If ⁄Backspace€ or ⁄Del€ follows one of the kill commands, the
deleted character becomes part of the text removed by the kill
command.  See the following section for information on the kill
commands.

The buffer-specific variable ¬delete-hacking-tabs≈delete-hacking-tabs makes
⁄Backspace€ operate differently when deleting tabs.
If nonzero, ⁄Backspace€ first turns the tab into the number
of spaces necessary to keep the cursor in the same column, then
deletes one of the spaces.

The key Alt-¥ deletes spaces and tabs surrounding point.

The Ctrl-X Ctrl-O command deletes empty lines adjacent to point, or lines
that contain only spaces and tabs, turning two or more such blank
lines into a single blank line.  Ctrl-X Ctrl-O deletes a lone blank line.
If you prefix a numeric argument of ªnº, exactly ªnº blank lines
appear regardless of the number of blank lines present originally.

3Killing Text

kill bufferscopying textmoving textdelete vs. killkill vs. deletekilling commandsregionRkilllineRkilldefRkillbufs

Epsilon has many commands to erase characters from a buffer.  Some
of these commands save the erased characters away in a special
group of buffers called ªkill buffersº, and some do not.

In Epsilon's terminology, to ªkillº means to delete
text and save it away in a kill buffer, and to ªdeleteº means
simply to remove the text and not save it away.  Any consecutive
sequence of killing commands will produce a single block of saved
text.  The Ctrl-Y command then yanks back the entire block of text,
inserting it before point.  (Even when Epsilon deletes text and
doesn't save it, you can usually use the undo command to
recover the text.  See Rundoπundo.)

The Ctrl-K command kills to the end of the line, but does not remove
the line separator.  At the end of a line, though, it kills just the
line separator.  Thus, use two Ctrl-K's to completely remove a
nonempty line.  Give this command a numeric argument of ªnº to kill
exactly ªnº lines, including the line separators.  If you give the
Ctrl-K command a negative numeric argument, ª-nº, the command kills
from the beginning of the previous ªnºth line to point.

The ¬kill-current-line command is an alternative to Ctrl-K.  It
kills the entire line in one step, including the line separator.  The
¬kill-to-end-of-line command kills the rest of the line.  If
point is at the end of the line, it does nothing.  In Brief mode
Epsilon uses these two commands in place of the kill-line
command that's normally bound to Ctrl-K.

RdelorkillThe commands to delete single characters will also
save the characters if you give them a numeric argument (to delete
that number of characters) or if they follow a command which itself
kills text.

regionmarkSeveral Epsilon commands operate on a ªregionº of text.  To
specify a region, move to either end of the region and press the Ctrl-@
key or the Ctrl-⁄Space€ key.  This sets the ªmarkº to the current
value of point.  Then move point to the other end of the region.  The
text between the mark and point specifies the region.

When you set the mark with Ctrl-@, Epsilon turns on highlighting for
the region.  As you move point away from the mark, the region appears
in a highlighted color.  This allows you to see exactly what text a
region-sensitive command would operate upon.  To turn the
highlighting off, type Ctrl-X Ctrl-H.  The Ctrl-X Ctrl-H command
toggles highlighting for the region.  If you prefix a nonzero numeric
argument, it turns highlighting on; a numeric argument of zero turns
highlighting off.

You can also check the ends of the region with the Ctrl-X Ctrl-X
command.  This switches point and mark, to let you see the other end
of the region.  Most commands do not care whether point (or mark)
refers to the beginning or the end of the region.

The ¬mark-whole-buffer command on Ctrl-X H provides a quick way
to set point and mark around the entire buffer.

Another way to select text is to hold down the Shift key and move
around using the arrow keys, or the keys ⁄Home€, ⁄End€,
⁄PageUp€, or ⁄PageDown€.  Epsilon will select the text you
move through.  The ¬shift-selects≈shift-selects variable controls this
feature.

The Ctrl-W command kills the region, saving it in a kill buffer.  The
Ctrl-Y command then yanks back the text you've just killed, whether by
the Ctrl-W command or any other command that kills text.  It sets the
region around the yanked text, so you can kill it again with a Ctrl-W,
perhaps after adjusting the region at either end.  The Alt-W command
works like Ctrl-W, except that it does not remove any text from the
buffer; it simply copies the text between point and mark to a kill
buffer.

Each time you issue a sequence of killing commands, Epsilon saves the
entire block of deleted text as a unit in one of its kill buffers.  The
Ctrl-Y command yanks back the last of these blocks.  To access the other
blocks of killed text, use the Alt-Y command.  It follows a Ctrl-Y or Alt-Y
command, and replaces the retrieved text with an earlier block of
killed text.  Each time you press Alt-Y, Epsilon substitutes a block from
another kill buffer, cycling from most recent back through the oldest,
and then around to the most recent again.

In normal use, you go to the place you want to insert the text and
issue the Ctrl-Y command.  If this doesn't provide the right text,
give the Alt-Y command repeatedly until you see the text you want.
If the text you want does not appear in any of the killed blocks, you
can get rid of the block with Ctrl-W, since both Ctrl-Y and Alt-Y
always place point and mark around the retrieved block.

By default, Epsilon provides ten kill buffers.  You can set the
variable ¬kill-buffers≈kill-buffers if you want a different number of kill
buffers.  Setting this variable to a new value makes Epsilon throw
away the contents of all the kill buffers the next time you execute a
command that uses kill buffers.

The Alt-Y command doesn't do anything if the region changed since the
last Ctrl-Y or Alt-Y, so you can't lose text with a misplaced Alt-Y.
Neither of these commands changes the kill buffers themselves.  The
Alt-Y command uses the undo facility, so if you've disabled undo, it
won't work.

Epsilon can automatically reindent yanked text.  By default it does
this in C mode buffers.  See Rreindentπreindent for details.  If
you invoke Ctrl-Y or Alt-Y with a negative numeric prefix argument,
by typing Alt-⁄Minus€ Ctrl-Y for example, the command won't
reindent the yanked text, and will insert one copy.  (Providing a
positive numeric prefix argument makes Epsilon yank that many copies
of the text.  See Rrepeatingπrepeating.)

Each time you issue a sequence of killing commands, all the killed
text goes into one kill buffer.  When a killing command follows a
non-killing command, the text goes into a new kill buffer (assuming
you haven't set up Epsilon to have only one kill buffer).  You may
sometimes want to append a new kill to the current kill buffer,
rather than using the next kill buffer.  That would let you yank all
the text back at once.  The Ctrl-Alt-W command makes an immediately
following kill command append to a kill buffer instead of moving to a
new one.

The Ctrl-Y command can come in handy when entering text for another
command.  For example, suppose the current buffer contains a line
with "report.txt" on it, and you now want to read in the
file with that name.  Simply kill the line with Ctrl-K and yank it back
(so as not to change the buffer) then give the Ctrl-X Ctrl-F
command (see Rfilecmdsπfilecmds) to read in a file.  When
prompted for the file name, press Ctrl-Y and the text "report.txt"
appears as if you typed it yourself.

Pressing a self-inserting key like "j" while text is highlighted
normally deletes the highlighted selection, replacing it with the
key.  Pressing ⁄Backspace€ simply deletes the text.  You can
disable this behavior by setting the variable
¬typing-deletes-highlight≈typing-deletes-highlight to zero.  If you turn off this
feature, you may also wish to set the variable
¬insert-default-response≈insert-default-response to zero.  At many prompts Epsilon will
insert a highlighted default response before you start typing, if
this variable is nonzero.

scratch buffersIn addition to the above commands which put
the text into temporary kill buffers, Epsilon provides commands to
make more permanent copies of text.  The Ctrl-X X key copies the text in
the region between point and mark to a permanent buffer.  The command
prompts you for a letter (or number), then associates the text with
that letter.  Thereafter, you can retrieve the text using the Ctrl-X Y
key.  That command asks you for the letter, then inserts the
corresponding text before point.

3Clipboard Access

clipboard, WindowsRclipboardIn Windows and DOS,
Epsilon's killing commands interact with the Windows clipboard.
(Similarly, Epsilon for Unix interacts with the X clipboard when
running as an X program.)  You can kill text in Epsilon and paste it
into another application, or copy text from an application
and bring it into Epsilon with the ¬yank command.

All commands that put text on the kill ring will also try to copy the
text to the clipboard, if the variable ¬clipboard-access≈clipboard-access is
non-zero.  You can copy the current region to the clipboard without
putting it on the kill ring using the command ¬copy-to-clipboard.

The ¬yank command copies new text from the clipboard to the top
of the kill ring.  It does this only when the clipboard's contents
have changed since the last time Epsilon accessed it, the clipboard
contains text, and clipboard-access is non-zero.
Epsilon looks at the size of the clipboard to determine if the text
on it is new, so it may not always notice new text.  You can force
Epsilon to retrieve text from the clipboard by using the
¬insert-clipboard command, which inserts the text on the
clipboard at point in the current buffer.

If you prefer to have Epsilon ignore the clipboard except when you
explicitly tell it otherwise, set clipboard-access to zero.
You can still use the commands ¬copy-to-clipboard and
¬insert-clipboard to work with the clipboard.  Unlike the
transparent clipboard support provided by clipboard-access,
these commands will report any errors that occur while trying to
access the clipboard.  If transparent clipboard support cannot access
the clipboard for any reason, it won't report an error, but will
simply ignore the clipboard.  Epsilon also disables transparent
clipboard support when running a keyboard macro.

By default, when Epsilon for DOS puts characters on the clipboard, it
lets Windows translate the characters from the OEM character set to
Windows ANSI, so that international characters display correctly.
Epsilon for Windows uses Windows ANSI like other Windows programs, so
no translation is needed.  See the description of the
clipboard-format variable in Rclipboardformatπclipboard-format to
change this.

Epsilon for DOS has some limitations on its clipboard access.  For
one thing, its clipboard support only functions when running under
Windows 3.1 or later or Windows 95/98, not under Windows NT.  Epsilon
for DOS cannot read a clipboard with more than 65,500 characters, and
will ignore the clipboard's contents in this case.  Similarly, if you
kill a block of text larger than 65,500 characters, Epsilon won't put
it on the clipboard.

3Rectangle Commands

RrectcmdsEpsilon regions actually come in four distinct types.
Each type has a corresponding Epsilon command that begins defining a
region of that type.

Ω– 2 20 Region TypeCommandNormalmark-normal-regionLinemark-line-regionInclusivemark-inclusive-regionRectangularmark-rectangle—æ

The commands are otherwise very similar.  Each command starts
defining a region of the specified type, setting the mark equal to
point and turning on highlighting.  If Epsilon is already
highlighting a region of a different type, these commands change the
type.  If Epsilon is already highlighting a region of the same type,
these commands start defining a new region by setting mark to point
again.  (You can set the variable ¬mark-unhighlights≈mark-unhighlights to make
the commands turn off the highlighting and leave the mark alone in
this case.)

The ¬mark-normal-region command defines the same kind of region
as the set-mark command described in Rkillbufsπkillbufs.
(The commands differ in that set-mark always begins defining
a new region, even if another type of region is highlighted on the
screen.  The mark-normal-region command converts the old
region, as described above.)

A line region always contains entire lines of text.  It consists of
the line containing point, the line containing mark, and all lines
between the two.

An inclusive region is very similar to a normal region, but an
inclusive region contains one additional character at the end of the
region.  A normal region contains all characters between point and
mark, if you think of point and mark as being positioned between
characters.  But if you think of point and mark as character
positions, then an inclusive region contains the character at point,
the character at the mark, and all characters between the two.  An
inclusive region always contains at least one character (unless point
and mark are both at the end of the buffer).

rectangle editingcolumn editingA rectangular region
consists of all columns between those of point and mark, on all lines
in the buffer between those of point and mark.  The
mark-rectangle command on Ctrl-X # begins defining a rectangular
region.  In a rectangular region, point can specify any of the four
corners of this rectangle.

Some commands operate differently when the current region is
rectangular.  Killing a rectangular region by pressing the Ctrl-W key
runs the command ¬kill-rectangle.  It saves the current
rectangle in a kill buffer, and replaces the rectangle with spaces,
so as not to shift any text that appears to the right of the
rectangle.  The Alt-W key runs the command ¬copy-rectangle.  It
also saves the current rectangle, but doesn't modify the buffer.
(Actually, it may insert spaces at the ends of lines, or convert tabs
to spaces, if that's necessary to reach the starting or ending column
on one of the lines in the region.  But the buffer won't look any
different as a result of these changes.  Most rectangle commands do
this.)  The Ctrl-Alt-W key runs the command ¬delete-rectangle.
It removes the current rectangle, shifting any text after it to the
left.  It doesn't save the rectangle.

When you use the Ctrl-Y key to yank a kill buffer that contains a
rectangle, Epsilon inserts the last killed rectangle into the buffer
at the current column, on the current and successive lines.  It
shifts existing text to the right.  If you've enabled overwrite mode,
however, the rectangle replaces any existing text in those columns.
You can use the Alt-Y key to cycle through previous kills as usual.

The width of a tab character depends upon the column it occurs in.
For this reason, if you use the rectangle commands to kill or copy
text containing tabs, and you move the tabs to a different column,
text after the tabs may shift columns.  (For example, a tab at column
0 occupies 8 columns, but a tab at column 6 occupies only 2 columns.)
You can avoid this problem by using spaces instead of tabs with the
rectangle commands.

The buffer-specific variable ¬indent-with-tabs≈indent-with-tabs controls whether
Epsilon does indenting with tabs or only with spaces.  Set it to 0 to
make Epsilon always use spaces.  This variable affects only future
indenting you may do; it doesn't change your file.  To replace the
tabs in your file, use the ¬untabify-buffer command.

3Capitalization

case, changingEpsilon has commands that allow you to change
the case of words.  Each travels forward, looking for the end of a
word, and changes the case of the letters it travels past.  Thus, if
you give these commands while inside a word, only the rest of the
word potentially changes case.

The Alt-L key, ¬lowercase-word, turns all the characters it passes
to lower case.  The Alt-U key, ¬uppercase-word, turns them all to
upper case.  The Alt-C key, ¬capitalize-word, capitalizes a word
by making the first letter it travels past upper case, and all the
rest lower case.  All these commands position point after the word
operated upon.

For example, the Alt-L command would turn "wOrd" into
"word".  The Alt-U command would turn it into "WORD", and
the Alt-C command would turn it into "Word".

These commands operate on the highlighted region, if there is one.
If there is no highlighted region, the commands operate on the next
word and move past it, as described above.  The commands work on both
conventional and rectangular regions.

3Replacing

searching, and replacingThe key Alt-& runs the command
¬replace-string, and allows you to change all occurrences of a
string in the rest of your document to another string.  Epsilon
prompts for the string to replace, and what to replace it with.
Terminate the strings with ⁄Enter€.  After you enter both
strings, Epsilon replaces all occurrences of the first string after
point with instances of the second string.

When entering the string to search for, you can use any of the
searching subcommands described in Rsearchsubcommandsπsearch-subcommands:
Ctrl-C toggles case-folding, Ctrl-W toggles word searching, and
Ctrl-T toggles interpreting the string as a regular expression.

To enter special characters in either the search or replace strings,
use Ctrl-Q before each.  Type Ctrl-Q Ctrl-C to include a Ctrl-C
character.  Type Ctrl-Q Ctrl-J to include a ⁄Newline€ character
in a search string or replacement text.

The key Alt-R runs the command ¬query-replace, which works
like replace-string.  Instead of replacing everything automatically,
however, the command positions point after each occurrence of the old
string and waits for you to press a key.  You may choose whether to
replace this occurrence or not:
Œy or Y or ⁄Space€ Replace it, go on to next occurrence.

Œn or N or ⁄Backspace€ Don't replace it, go on to next
occurrence.

Œ!Replace all remaining occurrences.  The
replace-string command works like the query-replace
command followed by pressing "!" when it shows you the first match.

Œ⁄Esc€ Exit and leave point at the match in the buffer.

Œ^ Back up to the previous match.

Œ⁄Period€ Replace this occurrence and then exit.

Œ⁄Comma€ Replace and wait for another command option
without going on to the next match.

ŒCtrl-R Enter a recursive edit.  Point and mark go around the
match.  You may edit arbitrarily.  When you exit the recursive edit
with Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z, Epsilon restores the old mark, and the query-replace
continues from the current location.

ŒCtrl-GExit and restore point to its original location.

ŒCtrl-TToggle regular expression searching.  See the next section for an
explanation of regular expressions.

ŒCtrl-WToggle word searching.

ŒCtrl-CToggle case folding.

Œ? or help key Provide help, including a list of these options.

Œanything else Exit the replacement, staying at the current location,
and execute this key as a command.


The command ¬regex-replace operates like query-replace,
but starts up in regular expression mode.  See Rregexreplacecmdπregex-replace-cmd.

The command ¬reverse-replace operates like ¬query-replace,
but moves backwards.  You can also trigger a reverse replacement by
pressing Ctrl-R while entering the search text for any of the replacing
commands.

If you invoke any of the replacing commands above with a numeric
argument, Epsilon will use word searching.

case replacementReplace commands preserve case.  Epsilon
examines the case of each match.  If a match is entirely upper case,
or all words are capitalized, Epsilon makes the replacement text
entirely upper case or capitalized, as appropriate.  Epsilon only
does this when searching is case-insensitive, and neither the search
string nor the replace string contain upper case letters.  For
example, if you search for the regular expression welcome|hello
and replace it with greetings, Epsilon replaces HELLO with
GREETINGS and Welcome with Greetings.

replacing in multiple filesThe ¬file-query-replace
command on Shift-F7 replaces text in multiple files.  It prompts for
the search text, replacement text, and a file name which may contain
wildcards.  You can use extended file patterns to replace in files
from multiple directories; see Rwildcardsπwildcards.  To search
without replacing, see the grep command in Rgrepcmdπgrep-cmd.

With a numeric argument, this command searches through buffers
instead of files.  Instead of prompting for a file name pattern,
Epsilon prompts for a buffer name pattern, and only operates on those
buffers whose names match that pattern.  Buffer name patterns use a
simplified file name pattern syntax: * matches zero or more
characters, ? matches any single character, and character classes
like [a-z] may be used too.

The command ¬delete-matching-lines prompts for a regular
expression pattern.  It then deletes all lines after point in the
current buffer that contain the pattern.  The similar command
¬keep-matching-lines deletes all lines ªexceptº those that
contain the pattern.  As with any searching command, you can press
Ctrl-T, Ctrl-W, or Ctrl-C while typing the pattern to toggle regular
expression mode, word mode, or case folding (respectively).

When you select a replacing command from the menu or tool bar (rather
than via a command's keyboard binding), Epsilon for Windows runs the
¬dialog-replace or ¬dialog-regex-replace command, to
display a replace dialog.  Controls on the dialog replace many of the
keys described above.

3Regular Expressions

pattern, searching for awildcard
searchingregular expressionsRregexMost of Epsilon's searching
commands, described in Rincrementalsearchπincrementalsearch, take a
simple string to search for.  Epsilon provides a more powerful
regular expression search facility, and a regular expression replace
facility.

Instead of a simple search string, you provide a pattern, which
describes a set of strings.  Epsilon searches the buffer for an
occurrence of one of the strings contained in the set.  You can think
of the pattern as generating a (possibly infinite) set of strings,
and the regex search commands as looking in the buffer for the first
occurrence of one of those strings.

The following characters have special meaning in a regex search:
vertical bar, parentheses, plus, star, question mark, square
brackets, period, dollar, percent sign, left angle bracket
("<"), and caret ("^").

Ω– 0 12 abc|defFinds either abc or def.(abc)Finds abc.abc+Finds abc or abcc or abccc or ... .abc*Finds ab or abc or abcc or abccc or ... .abc?Finds ab or abc.[abcx-z]Finds any single character of a, b, c, x, y, or z.[^abcx-z]Finds any single character except a, b, c, x, y, or z..Finds any single character except ⁄Newline€.abc$Finds abc that occurs at the end of a line.^abcFinds abc that occurs at the beginning of a line.%^abcFinds a literal ^abc.<Tab>Finds a ⁄Tab€ character.<#123>Finds the character with ASCII code 123.—æ

¿Summary of regular expression characters.¡

Plain Patterns

In a regular expression, a string that does not contain any of the above
characters denotes the set that contains precisely that one string.  For
example, the regular expression abc denotes the set that contains,
as its only member, the string "abc".  If you search for this
regular expression, Epsilon will search for the string "abc", just
as in a normal search.

Alternation

To include more than one string in the set, you can use the
vertical bar character.  For example, the regular expression abc|xyz
denotes the set that contains the strings "abc" and "xyz".  If you
search for that pattern, Epsilon will find the first occurrence of either
"abc" or "xyz".  The alternation operator (|) always applies
as widely as possible, limited only by grouping parentheses.

Grouping

You can enclose any regular expression in parentheses, and the
resulting expression refers to the same set.  So searching for
(abc|xyz) has the same effect as searching for abc|xyz,
which works as in the previous paragraph.  You would use parentheses
for grouping purposes in conjunction with some of the operators
described below.

Concatenation

You can concatenate two regular expressions to form a new
regular expression.  Suppose the regular expressions p and
q denote sets P and Q, respectively.  Then
the regular expression pq denotes the set of strings that
you can make by concatenating, to members of P, strings from
the set Q.  For example, suppose you concatenate the
regular expressions (abc|xyz) and (def|ghi) to yield
(abc|xyz)(def|ghi).  From the previous paragraph, we know that
(abc|xyz) denotes the set that contains "abc" and "xyz"; the
expression (def|ghi) denotes the set that contains "def" and
"ghi".  Applying the rule, we see that (abc|xyz)(def|ghi)
denotes the set that contains the following four strings:
"abcdef", "abcghi", "xyzdef", "xyzghi".

Closure

Clearly, any regular expression must have finite length;
otherwise you couldn't type it in.  But because of the closure
operators, the set to which the regular expression refers
may contain an infinite number of strings.  If you append plus to a
parenthesized regular expression, the resulting expression denotes
the set of one or more repetitions of that string.  For example,
the regular expression (ab)+ refers to the set that contains "ab",
"abab", "ababab", "abababab", and so on.  Star works similarly,
except it denotes the set of zero or more repetitions of the indicated
string.

Optionality

You can specify the question operator in the same place you might
put a star or a plus.  If you append a question mark to a
parenthesized regular expression, the resulting expression denotes
the set that contains that string, and the empty string.  You would
typically use the question operator to specify an optional
subpart of the search string.

You can also use the plus, star, and question-mark operators with
subexpressions, and with non-parenthesized things.  These operators
always apply to the smallest possible substring to their left.  For
example, the regular expression abc+ refers to the set that
contains "abc", "abcc", "abccc", "abcccc", and so on.  The
expression a(bc)*d refers to the set that contains
"ad", "abcd", "abcbcd", "abcbcbcd", and so on.
The expression a(b?c)*d denotes the set that contains all
strings that start with "a" and end with "d", with the inside
consisting of any number of the letter "c", each optionally
preceded by "b".  The set includes such strings
as "ad", "acd", "abcd", "abccccbcd".

¿Character mnemonics in regular expressions.¡

Entering special characters

In a regular expression, the percent ("%") character quotes
the next character, removing any special meaning that character
may have.  For example, the expression x%+ refers
to the string "x+", whereas the pattern
x+ refers to the set that contains
"x", "xx", "xxx", and so on.

You can also quote characters by enclosing them in angle brackets.
The expression x<+> refers to the string "x+", the
same as x%+.  In place of the character itself, you can
provide the name of the character inside the angle brackets.  The table lists all the character names Epsilon recognizes.

null, searching forTo search for the NUL character (the
character with ASCII code 0), you must use the expression
<Nul>, because an actual NUL character may not appear in a
regular expression.

Instead of the character's name, you can provide its numeric ASCII
value using the notation <#»number…>.  The sequence
<#»number…> denotes the character with ASCII code
»number….  For example, the pattern <#0> provides
another way to specify the NUL character, and the pattern
abc<#10>+ specifies the set of strings that begin with
"abc" and end with one or more newline characters (newline has
ASCII value 10).  You can enter the ASCII value in hexadecimal,
octal, or binary by prefixing the number with "0x", "0o", or "0b",
respectively.  For example, <#32>, <#0x20>,
<#0o40>, and <#0b100000> all yield a ⁄Space€
character (ASCII code 32).

Character Classes

character classIn place of any letter, you can specify a ªcharacter classº.  A
character class consists of a sequence of characters between square
brackets.  For example, the character class [adef] stands for
any of the following characters: "a", "d", "e", or "f".

In place of a letter in a character class, you can specify a range of
characters using a hyphen: the character class [a-m] stands for
the characters "a" through "m", inclusively.  The class
[ae-gr] stands for the characters "a", "e", "f", "g", or "r".
The class [a-zA-Z0-9] stands for any alphanumeric character.

To specify the complement of a character class, put a caret as the
first character in the class.  Using the above examples, the class
[^a-m] stands for any character other than "a" through "m", and
the class [^a-zA-Z0-9] stands for any non-alphanumeric
character.  Inside a character class, only ^ and -
have special meaning.  All other characters stand for
themselves, including plus, star, question mark, etc.

If you need to put a right square bracket character in
a character class, put it immediately after the opening
left square bracket, or in the case of an inverted character
class, immediately after the caret.  For example, the class
[]x] stands for the characters "]" or "x", and the class
[^]x] stands for any character other than "]" or "x".

To include the hyphen character - in a character class,
it must be the first character in the class, except for ^ and
].  For example, the pattern [^]-q] matches any character
except ], -, or q.

Any regular expression you can write with character classes you can
also write without character classes.  But character classes
sometimes let you write much shorter regular expressions.

The period character (outside a character class) represents any
character except a ⁄Newline€.  For example, the pattern a.c
matches any three-character sequence on a single line where the first
character is "a" and the last is "c".

You can also specify a character class using a variant of the angle
bracket syntax described above.  The expression
<Comma|Period|Question> represents any one of those three
punctuation characters.  The expression <a-z|A-Z|?>
represents either a letter or a question mark, the same as
[a-zA-Z]|<?>, for example.  The expression
<^Newline> represents any character except newline, just
as the period character by itself does.

You can also use a few character class names that match some common
sets of characters.  Some use Epsilon's current syntax table, which
an EEL program may modify, by way of the isalpha( ) primitive.
Typically these include accented characters like Í or Â.

Ω– 2 16 ClassMeaning<digit>A digit, 0 to 9.<alpha>A letter, according to isalpha( ).<alphanum>Either of the above.<word>All of the above, plus the _ character.<hspace>The same as <Space|Tab>.<wspace>The same as <Space|Tab|Newline>.<any>Any character including <Newline>.—æ

¿Character Class Names¡

More precisely, inside the angle brackets you can put one or more
character names, character ranges, or character class names,
separated by vertical bars.  (A range means two character names with
a hyphen between them.)  In place of a character name, you can put
# and the ASCII number of a character, or you can put the
character itself (for any character except >, |, -, or
⁄Nul€).  Finally, just after the opening <, you can put a
^ to specify the complement of the character class.

Examples

  The pattern if|else|for|do|while|switch specifies
the set of statement keywords in C and EEL.

 The pattern c[ad]+r specifies strings like "car",
"cdr", "caadr", "caaadar".  These correspond to
compositions of the car and cdr Lisp operations.

 The pattern c[ad][ad]?[ad]?[ad]?r specifies the strings
that represent up to four compositions of car and cdr in Lisp.

 The pattern [a-zA-Z]+ specifies the set of all sequences
of 1 or more letters.  The character class part denotes
any upper- or lower-case letter, and the plus operator specifies
one or more of those.

°Epsilon's commands to move by words accomplish their task by
performing a regular expression search.  They use a pattern similar
to [a-zA-Z0-9_]+, which specifies one or more letters, digits,
or underscore characters.  (The actual pattern includes international
characters as well.)

 The pattern
(<Newline>|<Return>|<Tab>|<Space>)+
specifies nonempty sequences of the whitespace characters newline,
return, tab, and space.  You could also write this pattern as
<Newline|Return|Tab|Space>+ or as
<Wspace|Return>+, using a character class name.

 The pattern /%*.*%*/ specifies a set that includes all 1-line
C-language comments.  The percent character quotes the first and
third stars, so they refer to the star character itself.  The middle
star applies to the period, denoting zero or more occurrences of any
character other than newline.  Taken together then, the pattern
denotes the set of strings that begin with "slash star", followed
by any number of non-newline characters, followed by "star slash".
You can also write this pattern as /<Star>.*<Star>/.

 The pattern /%*(.|<Newline>)*%*/ looks like the
previous pattern, except that instead of ".", we have
(.|<Newline>).  So instead of "any character except
newline", we have "any character except newline, or newline", or
more simply, "any character at all".  This set includes all C
comments, with or without newlines in them.  You could also write
this as  /%*<Any>*%*/ instead.

 The pattern <^digit|a-f> matches any character
except of one these: 0123456789abcdef.

An advanced example

Let's build a regular expression that includes precisely the set of
legal strings in the C programming language.  All C strings begin and end
with double quote characters.  The inside of the string denotes a
sequence of characters.  Most characters stand for themselves, but
newline, double quote, and backslash must appear after a "quoting"
backslash.  Any other character may appear after a backslash as well.

We want to construct a pattern that generates the set of all
possible C strings.  To capture the idea that the pattern must begin
and end with a double quote, we begin by writing

   "»something…"

We still have to write the »something… part, to generate
the inside of the C strings.  We said that the inside of a C string
consists of a sequence of characters.  The star operator means
"zero or more of something".  That looks promising, so we write

   "(»something…)*"

Now we need to come up with a »something… part that
stands for an individual character in a C string.  Recall that
characters other than newline, double quote, and backslash stand for
themselves.  The pattern <^Newline|"|¥> captures
precisely those characters.  In a C string, a "quoting" backslash
must precede the special characters (newline, double quote, and
backslash).  In fact, a backslash may precede any character in a C
string.  The pattern ¥(.|<Newline>) means,
precisely "backslash followed by any character".  Putting those
together with the alternation operator (|), we get the pattern
<^Newline|"|¥>|¥(.|<Newline>) which
generates either a single "normal" character or any character
preceded by a backslash.  Substituting this pattern for the
»something… yields

   "(<^Newline|"|¥>|¥(.|<Newline>))*"

which represents precisely the set of legal C strings.
In fact, if you type this pattern into a regex-search command
(described below), Epsilon will find the next C string in the
buffer.

Searching Rules

Thus far, we have described regular expressions in terms of
the abstract set of strings they generate.  In this section, we
discuss how Epsilon uses this abstract set when it does
a regular expression search.

When you tell Epsilon to perform a forward regex search, it
looks forward through the buffer for the first occurrence in the buffer
of a string contained in the generated set.  If no such
string exists in the buffer, the search fails.

There may exist several strings in the buffer that match a string in
the generated set.  Which one qualifies as the first one?  By
default, Epsilon picks the string in the buffer that begins before
any of the others.  If there exist two or more matches in the buffer
that begin at the same place, Epsilon by default picks
the longest one.  We call this a first-beginning, longest match.
For example, suppose you position point at the beginning of the
following line,

  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought

then do a regex search for the pattern s[a-z]*.  That
pattern describes the set of strings that start with "s", followed by
zero or more letters.  We can find quite a few strings on this line
that match that description.  Among them:

Ω– 0 When to the ∞s±essions of sweet silent thoughtWhen to the ∞sessi±ons of sweet silent thoughtWhen to the ∞sessions± of sweet silent thoughtWhen to the ses∞sion±s of sweet silent thoughtWhen to the sessions of ∞sweet± silent thoughtWhen to the sessions of sweet ∞sil±ent thought—æ

Here, the underlined sections indicate portions of the
buffer that match the description "s followed by a sequence of
letters".  We could identify 31 different occurrences of such
strings on this line.  Epsilon picks a match that begins first, and
among those, a match that has maximum length.  In our example, then,
Epsilon would pick the following match:

  When to the ∞sessions± of sweet silent thought

since it begins as soon as possible, and goes on for
as long as possible.  The search would position point after
the final "s" in "sessions".

In addition to the default first-beginning, longest match searching,
Epsilon provides three other regex search modes.  You can specify
first-beginning or first-ending searches.  For each of these, you can specify
shortest or longest match matches.  Suppose, with point positioned
at the beginning of the following line

  I summon up remembrance of things past,

you did a regex search with the pattern
m.*c|I.*t.  Depending on which regex mode
you chose, you would get one of the four following
matches:

Ω– 0 46 I summon up reme∞mbranc±e of things past,(first-ending shortest)I su∞mmon up remembranc±e of things past,(first-ending longest)∞I summon up remembrance of t±hings past,(first-beginning shortest)∞I summon up remembrance of things past±,(first-beginning longest)—æ

By default, Epsilon uses first-beginning, longest matching.  You can
include directives in the pattern itself to tell Epsilon to use one
of the other techniques.  If you include the directive
<Min> anywhere in the pattern, Epsilon will use
shortest-matching instead of longest-matching.  Putting
<FirstEnd> selects first-ending instead of
first-beginning.  You can also put <Max> for
longest-matching, and <FirstBegin> for first-beginning.
These last two might come in handy if you've changed Epsilon's
default regex mode.  The sequences <FE> and
<FB> provide shorthand equivalents for
<FirstEnd> and <FirstBegin>, respectively.
As an example, you could use the following patterns to select each of
the matches listed in the previous example:

Ω– 0 22 28 44 <FE><Min>m.*c|I.*t(first-ending shortest)<FE><Max>m.*c|I.*tor<FE>m.*c|I.*t(first-ending longest)<FB><Min>m.*c|I.*tor<Min>m.*c|I.*t(first-beginning shortest)<FB><Max>m.*c|I.*torm.*c|I.*t(first-beginning longest)—æ

You can change Epsilon's default regex searching mode.  To make
Epsilon use, by default, first-ending searches, set the variable
¬regex-shortest≈regex-shortest to a nonzero value.  To specify first-ending
searches, set the variable ¬regex-first-end≈regex-first-end to a nonzero value.

When Epsilon finds a regex match, it sets point to the end of the
match.  It also sets the variables matchstart≈matchstart and
matchend≈matchend to the beginning and end, respectively, of the match.
You can change what Epsilon considers the end of the match
using the "!" directive.  For example, if you searched for
"I s!ought" in the following line, Epsilon would
match the underlined section:

  I sigh the lack of many a thing ∞I s±ought,

Without the "!" directive, the match would consist
of the letters "I sought", but because of the "!" directive,
the match consists of only the indicated section of the line.
Notice that the first three characters of the line also
consist of "I s", but  Epsilon does not count that as a match.
There must first exist a complete match in the buffer.  If so,
Epsilon will then set point and matchend according to
any "!" directive.

You can force Epsilon to reject any potential match that does not
line up appropriately with a line boundary, by using the "^" and
"$" assertions.  A "^" assertion specifies a beginning-of-line match,
and a "$" assertion specifies an end-of-line match.  For example,
if you search for ^new|waste in the following line, it would match
the indicated section:

  And with old woes new wail my dear times's ∞waste±;

Even though the word "new" occurs before "waste", it does
not appear at the beginning of the line, so Epsilon rejects it.

Other assertions use Epsilon's angle-bracket syntax.  Like the
assertions ^ and $, these don't match any specific
characters, but a potential match will be rejected if the assertion
isn't true at that point in the pattern.

Ω– 2 20 AssertionMeaning^At the start of a line.$At the end of a line.<bob> or <bof>At the start of the buffer.<eob> or <eof>At the end of the buffer.—æ

For example, searching for <bob>sometext<eob> won't
succeed unless the buffer contains only the eight character string
sometext.

You can create new assertions from character classes specified
with the angle bracket syntax by adding [, ] or / at the
start of the pattern.

Ω– 2 16 AssertionMeaning<[»class…>The next character matches »class…, the previous one does not.<]»class…>The previous character matches »class…, the next one does not.</»class…>Either of the above.—æ

The »class… in the above syntax is a |-separated list of one or
more single characters, character names like Space or Tab, character
numbers like #32 or #9, ranges of any of these, or
character class names like Word or Digit.

For example, </word> matches at a word boundary, and
<]word> matches at the end of a word.  The pattern
<]0-9|a-f> matches at the end of a run of
hexadecimal digits.  And the pattern
(cat|[0-9])</digit>(dog|[0-9]) matches cat3 or
4dog, but not catdog or 42.

Overgenerating regex sets

You can use Epsilon's regex search modes to simplify patterns
that you write.  You can sometimes write a pattern that includes
more strings than you really want, and rely on a regex search
mode to cut out strings that you don't want.

For example, recall the earlier example of /%*(.|<Newline>)*%*/.
This pattern generates the set of all strings that begin with /*
and end with */.  This set includes all the C-language comments,
but it includes some additional strings as well.  It includes,
for example, the following illegal C comment:

  /* inside /* still inside */  outside */

In C, a comment begins with /* and ends with the ªvery nextº
occurrence of */.  You can effectively get that by modifying
the above pattern to specify a first-ending, longest match, with
<FE><Max>/%*(.|<Newline>)*%*/.  It would match:

  ∞/* inside /* still inside */±  outside */

In this example, you could have written a more complicated regular
expression that generated precisely the set of legal C comments, but
this pattern proves easier to write.

The Regex Commands

You can invoke a forward regex search with the Ctrl-Alt-S key, which runs
the command ¬regex-search.  The Ctrl-Alt-R key invokes a reverse
incremental search.  You can also enter regular expression mode from
any search prompt by typing Ctrl-T to that prompt.  For example, if you
press Ctrl-S to invoke incremental-search, pressing Ctrl-T causes
it to enter regular expression mode.  See Rincrementalsearchπincrementalsearch for a description of the searching
commands.

Rregex-replace-cmdThe key Alt-* runs the command
¬regex-replace.  This command works like the command
query-replace, but interprets its search string as a
regular expression.

In the replacement text of a regex replace, the # character followed by a
digit »n… has a special meaning in the replacement text.  Epsilon
finds the »n…th parenthesized expression in the pattern,
counting left parentheses from 1.  It then substitutes
the match of this subpattern for the #»n… in the replacement text.
For example, replacing

Ω([a-zA-Z0-9_]+) = ([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)æ

with

Ω#2 := #1æ

changes

Ωvariable = value;æ

to

Ω KCtrl-Alt-S KCtrl-Alt-R KAlt-*value := variable;æ

If #0 appears in the replacement text, Epsilon substitutes the
entire match for the search string.  To include the actual character
# in a replacement text, use ##.

Other characters in the replacement text have no special meaning.  To
enter special characters, type a Ctrl-Q before each.  Type Ctrl-Q
Ctrl-C to include a Ctrl-C character.  Type Ctrl-Q Ctrl-J to include
a ⁄Newline€ character in the replacement text.

3Rearranging
4Sorting

sortingRsort-cmdsEpsilon provides several commands to
sort buffers, or parts of buffers.

The ¬sort-buffer command lets you sort the lines of the current
buffer.  The command asks for the name of a buffer in which to place
the sorted output.  The ¬sort-region command sorts the part of
the current buffer between point and mark, in place.  The commands
¬reverse-sort-buffer and ¬reverse-sort-region operate like
the above commands, but reverse the sorting order.

By default, all the sorting commands sort the lines by considering
all the characters in the line.  If you prefix a numeric argument of
ªnº to any of these commands, they will compare lines starting at
column ªnº.

When comparing lines of text during sorting, Epsilon normally folds
lower case letters to upper case before comparison, if the
¬case-fold≈case-fold variable has a nonzero value.  If the
case-fold variable has a value of 0, Epsilon compares
characters as-is.  However, setting the buffer-specific
¬sort-case-fold≈sort-case-fold variable to 0 or 1 overrides the case-fold
variable, for sorting purposes.  By default, sort-case-fold
has a value of 2, which means to defer to case-fold.

4Transposing

 KCtrl-X Ctrl-T KAlt-T KCtrl-Ttransposing thingsEpsilon has commands to transpose
characters, words, and lines.  To transpose the words before and
after point, use the Alt-T command.  This command leaves undisturbed
any non-word characters between the words.  Point moves between the
words.  The Ctrl-X Ctrl-T command transposes the current and previous lines
and moves point between them.

The Ctrl-T command normally transposes the characters before and after
point.  However, at the start of a line it transposes the first two
characters on the line, and at the end of a line it transposes the
last two.  On a line with one or no characters, it does nothing.

4Formatting Text

fill columnparagraphs, fillingRfillingRformatEpsilon has some commands
that make typing manuscript text easier.

You can change the right margin, or ªfill columnº,
using the Ctrl-X F command.  By default, it has a value of 70.  With
a numeric argument, the command sets the fill column to that column
number.  Otherwise, this command tells you the current value of the
fill column and asks you for a new value.  If you don't provide a new
value but instead press the ⁄Enter€ key, Epsilon will use the
value of point's current column.  For example, you can set the fill
column to column 55 by typing Ctrl-U 55 Ctrl-X F.
Alternatively, you can set the fill column to point's column by
typing Ctrl-X F ⁄Enter€.  The buffer-specific variable
¬margin-right≈margin-right stores the value of the fill column.  To set the
default value for new buffers you create, use the
set-variable command on F8 to set the default value of the
margin-right variable.

word wrap moderight margin wrapIn ªauto fill
modeº, you don't have to worry about typing ⁄Enter€'s to go to
the next line.  Whenever a line gets too long, Epsilon breaks the
line at the appropriate place if needed.  The ¬auto-fill-mode
command enables or disables auto filling (word wrap) for the current
buffer.  With a numeric argument of zero, it turns auto filling off;
with a nonzero numeric argument, it turns auto filling on.  With no
numeric argument, it toggles auto filling.  During auto fill mode,
Epsilon shows the word "Fill" in the mode line.  The
buffer-specific variable ¬fill-mode≈fill-mode controls filling.  If it
has a nonzero value, filling occurs.  To make Epsilon always use auto
fill mode, you can use the set-variable command to set the
default value of ¬fill-mode≈fill-mode.

In C mode, Epsilon uses a special version of auto-fill mode that
normally only fills text in certain types of comments.  See the
variable c-auto-fill-mode for details.

Epsilon normally indents new lines it inserts via auto fill mode so
they match the previous line.  The buffer-specific variable
¬auto-fill-indents≈auto-fill-indents controls whether or not Epsilon does this.
Epsilon indents these new lines only if auto-fill-indents has a
nonzero value.  Set the variable to 0 if you don't want this behavior.

During auto filling, the normal-character command first
checks to see if the line extends past the fill column.  If so, the
extra words automatically move down to the next line.

The ⁄Enter€ key runs the command ¬enter-key, which behaves
like normal-character, but inserts a newline instead of the
character that invoked it.  Epsilon binds this command to the
⁄Enter€ key, because Epsilon uses the convention that Ctrl-J's
separate lines, but the keyboard has the ⁄Enter€ key yield a Ctrl-M.
In overwrite mode, the ⁄Enter€ key simply moves to the beginning
of the next line.

The Alt-Q command fills the current paragraph.  The command fills
each line by moving words between lines as necessary, so the lines
but the last become as long as possible without extending past the
fill column.  If the screen shows a highlighted region, the command
fills all paragraphs in the region.  The ¬fill-region command
fills all paragraphs in the region between point and mark, whether or
not the region is highlighted.

If you give a numeric prefix argument of five or less to the filling
commands, they unwrap lines in a paragraph, removing all line breaks.
Alt-2 Alt-Q is one quick way to unwrap the current paragraph.  With a
numeric argument greater than 5, the paragraph is filled using that
value as a temporary right margin.  (Note that C mode places a
different fill command on Alt-Q, and it interprets an argument to
mean "fill using the current column as a right margin".)

3Indenting Commands

indentingEpsilon can help with indenting your program or
other text.  The ⁄Tab€ key runs the ¬indent-previous
command, which makes the current line start at the same column as the
previous non-blank line.  Specifically, if you invoke this command
with point in or adjacent to a line's indentation,
indent-previous replaces that indentation with the
indentation of the previous non-blank line.  If point's indentation
exceeds that of the previous non-blank line, or if you invoke this
command with point outside of the line's indentation, this command
simply inserts a ⁄Tab€.  See Rsettabsizeπsettabsize for
information on changing the width of a tab.

Epsilon can automatically indent for you when you press ⁄Enter€.
Setting the buffer-specific variable ¬auto-indent≈auto-indent nonzero makes
Epsilon do this.  The way Epsilon indents depends on the current
mode.  For example, C mode knows how to indent for C programs.
In Epsilon's default mode, fundamental mode, Epsilon indents
like indent-previous if you set auto-indent nonzero.

When Epsilon automatically inserts new lines for you in auto fill
mode, it looks at a different variable to determine whether to indent
these new lines.  Epsilon indents in this case only if the
buffer-specific variable ¬auto-fill-indents≈auto-fill-indents has a nonzero value.

The Alt-M key moves point to the beginning of the text on the current
line, just past the indentation.

The ¬indent-under command functions like indent-previous,
but each time you invoke it, it indents more, to align with the next
word in the line above.  In detail, it goes to the same column in the
previous non-blank line, and looks to the right for the end of the
next region of spaces and tabs.  It indents the current line to that
column after removing spaces and tabs from around point.

The ¬indent-rigidly command, bound to Ctrl-X Ctrl-I (or Ctrl-X
⁄Tab€), changes the indentation of each line between point and
mark by a fixed amount provided as a numeric argument.  For instance,
Ctrl-U 8 Ctrl-X Ctrl-I moves all the lines to the right by eight
spaces.  With no numeric argument, lines move to the right by the
buffer's tab size (default 8; see Rsettabsizeπsettabsize), and
with a negative numeric argument, lines move to the left.  So, for
example, Ctrl-U -1000 Ctrl-X Ctrl-I should remove all the
indentation from the lines between point and mark.

If you highlight a region before pressing ⁄Tab€ (or any key that
runs one of the commands indent-previous,
indent-under, or do-c-indent), Epsilon indents all
lines in the region by one tab stop, by calling the
indent-rigidly command.  You can provide a numeric argument
to specify how much indentation you want.

The Shift-⁄Tab€ key moves the cursor back to the previous tab
stop.  But if you highlight a region before pressing it, it will
remove one tab stop's worth of indentation.

The ¬indent-region command, bound to Ctrl-Alt-¥,
works similarly.  It goes to the start of each line between point and
mark and invokes the command bound to ⁄Tab€.  If the resulting
line then contains only spaces and tabs, Epsilon removes them.

RreindentYou can set up Epsilon to automatically reindent text
when you yank it.  Epsilon will indent like indent-region.
By default, Epsilon does this only for C mode (see the
reindent-after-c-yank variable).

To determine whether to reindent yanked text, the yank
command first looks for a variable whose name is derived from the
buffer's mode as it appears in the mode line:
reindent-after-c-yank for C mode buffers,
reindent-after-html-yank for HTML mode buffers, and so forth.  If
there's no variable by that name, Epsilon uses the
¬reindent-after-yank≈reindent-after-yank variable instead.  Instead of a variable,
you can write an EEL function with the same name; Epsilon will call
it and use its return value.  See the description of
reindent-after-yank for details on what different values do.

The Alt-S command horizontally centers the current line between the
first column and the fill column by padding the left with spaces and
tabs as necessary.  Before centering the line, the command removes
spaces and tabs from the beginning and end of the line.

RindentingWith any of these commands, Epsilon indents by
inserting as many tabs as possible without going past the desired
column, and then inserting spaces as necessary to reach the column.
You can set the size of a tab by setting the ¬tab-size≈tab-size
variable.  If you prefer, you can make Epsilon indent using only
spaces.  The buffer-specific variable ¬indent-with-tabs≈indent-with-tabs
controls this behavior.  Set it to 0 using set-variable to
make Epsilon use only spaces when inserting indentation.

tabs,
used for indentingThe ¬untabify-region command on Ctrl-X Alt-I changes all tab
characters between point and mark to the number of spaces necessary
to make the buffer look the same.  The ¬tabify-region command on
Ctrl-X Alt-⁄Tab€ does the reverse.  It looks at all runs of spaces and
tabs, and replaces each with tabs and spaces to occupy the same
number of columns.  The commands ¬tabify-buffer and
¬untabify-buffer are similar, but operate on the entire buffer,
instead of just the region.

2Language Modes

extensions, filehook, when reading in a
filesuffix_ subroutinesRsuffix
When you use the
find-file command to read in a file, Epsilon looks at the
file's extension to see if it has a mode appropriate for editing that
type of file.  For example, when you read a .h file, Epsilon goes
into C mode.  Specifically, whenever you use find-file and
give it a file name "foo.»ext…", after find-file reads in the
file, it executes a command named "suffix_»ext…", if such a
command exists.  The find-file command constructs a
subroutine name from the file extension to allow you to customize
what happens when you begin editing a file with that extension.  For
example, if you want to enter C mode automatically whenever you use
find-file on a ".x" file, you simply create a command (a
keyboard macro would do) called "suffix_x", and have that
command call c-mode.  For another example, you can easily
stop Epsilon from automatically entering C mode on a ".h" file by
using the delete-name command to delete the subroutine
"suffix-h".  (You can interchange the
- and _ characters in Epsilon command names.)

In addition to the language-specific modes described in the following
sections, Epsilon includes modes that support various Epsilon
features.  For example, the buffer listing generated by the
bufed command on Ctrl-X Ctrl-B is actually in an Epsilon
buffer, and that buffer is in Bufed mode.

Many language modes will call a hook function if you've defined one.
For example, C mode tries to call a function named c_mode_hook().
A hook function is a good place to customize a mode by setting
buffer-specific variables.  It can be a keyboard macro or a function
written in EEL, and it will be called whenever Epsilon loads a file
that should be in the specified mode.

The ¬fundamental-mode command removes changes to key bindings
made by modes such as C mode, Dired mode, or Bufed mode.

3Asm Mode

Asm modeEpsilon automatically enters Asm mode when you read
a file with an extension of .asm, .inc, .al, .mac, or .asi.  In Asm
mode, Epsilon does appropriate syntax highlighting, tagging, and
commenting.  The compile-buffer command uses the
¬compile-asm-cmd≈compile-asm-cmd variable in this mode.


asm-mode


3C Mode

C++ modeJava modeRcmodeThe ¬c-mode
command puts the current buffer in C mode.  In C mode, the
⁄Enter€ key indents the next line appropriately for a program
written in C, C++, Java, Epsilon's extension language EEL, or other
C-like languages.  It examines previous lines to find the correct
indentation.  It doesn't do a perfect job, but usually guesses
correctly.  Epsilon supports several common styles of indentation,
controlled by some extension language variables.

The ¬Closeback≈Closeback variable controls the position of the closing
brace:

ªCloseback = 0;º
≤Ωif (foo){≤    bar();≤    baz();≤    }≤æ≤ªCloseback = 1;º
≤Ωif (foo){≤    bar();≤    baz();≤}≤æ≤

By placing the opening brace on the following line, you may also use
these styles:

ªCloseback = 0;º
≤Ωif (foo)≤    {≤    bar();≤    baz();≤    }≤æ≤ªCloseback = 1;º
≤Ωif (foo)≤{≤    bar();≤    baz();≤}≤æ≤

¬Closeback≈Closeback by default has a value of 1.

Use the ¬Topindent≈Topindent variable to control the indentation of
top-level statements in a function:

ªTopindent = 0;º
≤Ωfoo()≤{≤if (bar)≤    baz();≤}≤æ≤ªTopindent = 1;º
≤Ωfoo()≤{≤    if (bar)≤        baz();≤}≤æ≤

¬Topindent≈Topindent by default has a value of 1.

The ¬Matchdelim≈Matchdelim variable controls whether typing ), ], or
∂ displays the corresponding (, [, or µ using the
¬show-matching-delimiter command.  The Matchdelim
variable normally has a value of 1, which means that Epsilon shows
matching delimiters.  You can change these variables as described in Rvarsettingπvarsetting.

In C mode, the ⁄Tab€ key reindents the current line if pressed
with point in the current line's indentation.  ⁄Tab€ just inserts
a tab if pressed with point somewhere else, or if pressed two or more
times successively.  If you set the variable
¬c-tab-always-indents≈c-tab-always-indents to 1, then the ⁄Tab€ key will
reindent the current line, regardless of your position on the line.
If you press it again, it will insert another tab.

When you yank text into a buffer in C mode, Epsilon automatically
reindents it.  This is similar to the "smart paste" feature in some
other editors.  You can set the variable ¬reindent-after-c-yank≈reindent-after-c-yank
to zero to disable this behavior.  Epsilon doesn't normally reindent
comments when yanking; set the ¬reindent-c-comments≈reindent-c-comments and
¬reindent-one-line-c-comments≈reindent-one-line-c-comments variables to change that.

By default, Epsilon uses the value of the buffer-specific
¬tab-size≈tab-size variable to determine how far to indent.  For
example, if the tab size has a value of 5, Epsilon will indent the
line following an if statement five additional columns.

If you want the width of a tab character in C mode buffers to be
different than in other buffers, set the variable
¬c-tab-override≈c-tab-override to the desired value.  C mode will change the
buffer's tab size to the specified number of columns.

If you want to use one value for the tab size and a different one for
C indentation, set the buffer-specific ¬c-indent≈c-indent variable to
the desired indentation using the set-variable command.  When
c-indent has a value of zero, as it has by default, Epsilon
uses the tab-size variable for its indentation.  (Actually, the
⁄Tab€ key in C mode doesn't necessarily insert a tab when you
press it two or more times in succession.  Instead, it indents
according to c-indent.  If the tab size differs from the C
indent, it may have to insert spaces to reach the proper column.)

The ¬c-case-offset≈c-case-offset variable controls the indentation of
case statements.  Normally, Epsilon indents them one level more
than their controlling switch statements.  Epsilon adds the value
of this variable to its normal indentation, though.  If you normally
indent by 8 spaces, for example, and want case statements to
line up with their surrounding switch statements, set
c-case-offset to -8.

By default, the C indenter tries to align continuation lines under
parentheses and other syntactic items on prior lines.  If Epsilon
can't find anything on prior lines to align under, it indents
continuation lines two levels more than the original line.  (With
default settings, Epsilon indents unalignable continuation lines 8
positions to the right of the original line.)  Epsilon adds the value
of the variable ¬c-contin-offset≈c-contin-offset to this indentation, though.
If you want Epsilon to indent unalignable continuation lines ten
columns less, set c-contin-offset to -10 (it's 0 by
default).

If aligning the continuation line would make it start in a column
greater than the value of the variable ¬c-align-contin-lines≈c-align-contin-lines
(default 48), Epsilon won't align the continuation line.  It will
indent by two levels plus the value of c-contin-offset, as
described above.

As a special case, setting the c-align-contin-lines to zero
makes Epsilon never try to align continuation lines under syntactic
features on prior lines.  Epsilon will then indent all continuation
lines by one level more than the original line (one extra tab,
normally), plus the value of the variable c-contin-offset.

The ¬c-label-indent≈c-label-indent variable provides the indentation of
lines starting with labels.  Normally, Epsilon moves labels to the
left margin.

Epsilon offsets the indentation of a left brace on its own line
by the value of the variable ¬c-brace-offset≈c-brace-offset.  For example,
with a tab size of eight and default settings for other variables, a
c-brace-offset of 2 produces:

Ω         K⁄Tab€ÀC Mode only K{ÀC Mode only K}ÀC Mode only K:ÀC Mode only K#ÀC Mode only K)ÀC Mode only K]ÀC Mode onlyif (a)≤          {≤                b();≤          }≤æ≤
The variable ¬c-top-braces≈c-top-braces controls how much Epsilon indents
the braces of the top-level block of a function.  By default, Epsilon
puts these braces at the left margin.  Epsilon indents pre-ANSI
K&R-style parameter declarations according to the variable
¬c-param-decl≈c-param-decl.  Epsilon indents parts of a top-level structure
or union according to ¬c-top-struct≈c-top-struct, and indents continuation
lines outside of any function body according to ¬c-top-contin≈c-top-contin.

4Other C mode Features

ifdef lines, moving bypreprocessor lines, moving byIn
C mode, the Alt-⁄Down€ and Alt-⁄Up€ keys move to the next or
previous #if/#else/#endif preprocessor line.  When starting from
such a line, Epsilon finds the next/previous matching one, skipping
over inner nested preprocessor lines.  Alt-] and Alt-[ do the same.
Press Alt-i to display a list of the preprocessor conditionals that
are in effect for the current line.

When the cursor is on a brace, bracket, or parenthesis, Epsilon will
try to locate its matching brace, bracket, or parenthesis, and
highlight them both.  If the current character has no match, Epsilon
will not highlight it.  Set the variable ¬auto-show-c-delimiters≈auto-show-c-delimiters
to zero to disable this feature.

Press Alt-' to display a list of all functions and global
variables defined in the current file.  You can move to a definition
in the list and press ⁄Enter€ and Epsilon will go to that
definition, or press Ctrl-G to remain at the starting point.  By
default, this command skips over external declarations.  With a
prefix numeric argument, it includes those too.

Epsilon normally auto-fills text in block comments as you type,
breaking overly long lines.  See the ¬c-auto-fill-mode≈c-auto-fill-mode
variable.  As with normal auto-fill mode (see Rfillingπfilling), use Ctrl-X F to set the right margin for filling.
Set the ¬c-fill-column≈c-fill-column variable to change the default right
margin in C mode buffers.

You can manually refill the current paragraph in a block comment (or
in a comment that follows a line of code) by pressing Alt-q.  If you
provide a numeric prefix argument to Alt-q, say by typing Alt-2
Alt-q, it will fill using the current column as the right margin.

Epsilon's tagging facility isn't specific to C mode, so it's
described elsewhere (see Rtagsπtags).  But it's one of
Epsilon's most useful software development features, so we mention it
here too.

Whenever you use the find-file command to read in a file with
one of the extensions .c, .h, .e, .y, .cpp, .cxx, .java, .inl, .hpp,
.idl, or .hxx, Epsilon automatically enters C mode.  See Rsuffixπsuffix for information on adding new extensions to this
list, or preventing Epsilon from automatically entering C mode.  For
file names without a suffix, Epsilon examines their contents and
guesses whether the file is C++, Perl, or unrecognizable.

commenting characters, and highlighting name=value assignments.

3GAMS Mode

.dat extensions.  The GAMS language is used for mathematical
programming.

In GAMS mode, Epsilon does syntax highlighting, recognizing GAMS
strings and comments.  The GAMS language permits a file to define its
own additional comment character sequences, besides the standard
* and $ontext and $offtext, but Epsilon doesn't try to
interpret these; instead it follows the convention that ! starts
a single-line comment anywhere on a line.

When the cursor is on a bracket or parenthesis, Epsilon will try to
locate its matching bracket or parenthesis, and highlight them both.
If the current character has no match, Epsilon will not highlight it.

In HTML mode, Epsilon does appropriate syntax highlighting (including
embedded JavaScript) and brace-matching.  The commenting commands
work too.

When the cursor is on a < or > character,
Epsilon will try to locate its matching > or < and highlight them both.  If the current character has no match,

3Makefile Mode

 KAlt-iÀMakefile mode onlyMakefile modeEpsilon automatically enters Makefile mode when
you read a file named makefile (or Makefile, etc.) or with an
extension of .mak.  In Makefile mode, Epsilon does appropriate syntax
highlighting.  The compile-buffer command uses the
¬compile-makefile-cmd≈compile-makefile-cmd variable in this mode.  Press Alt-i to
display a list of the preprocessor conditionals that are in effect
for the current line.  (For this command, Epsilon assumes that a
makefile uses Gnu Make syntax under Unix, and Microsoft makefile
syntax elsewhere.)

3Perl Mode

perl-string color classperl-constant color classperl-variable color classperl-function color classperl-comment color classPerl modeRperlmodeEpsilon automatically enters Perl
mode when you read a file with an extension of .perl, .pm, .al, .ph,
or .pl (or when you read a file with no extension that starts with a
#! line mentioning Perl).  The compile-buffer command
uses the ¬compile-perl-cmd≈compile-perl-cmd variable in this mode.

Epsilon's syntax highlighting uses the perl-comment color
for comments and POD documentation, the perl-function color
for function names, and the perl-variable color for variable
names.

Epsilon uses the perl-constant color for numbers, labels,
the simple argument of an angle operator such as <INPUT>, names
of imported packages, buffer text after __END__ or __DATA__,
here documents, format specfications (apart from any variables and
comments within), and the operators my and local.

Epsilon uses the perl-string color for string literals of
all types (including regular expression arguments to s///, for
instance).  Interpolated variables and comments are colored
appropriately whenever the string's context permits interpolation.

perl-keyword color classEpsilon uses the perl-keyword color for selected Perl
operators (mostly those involved in flow control, like foreach or
goto, or with special syntax rules, like tr or format), and modifiers
like /x after regular expressions.

Perl mode's automatic indentation features use a modified version of
C mode.  See Rcmodeπcmode for information on customizing
indentation.  Perl uses a different set of customization variables
whose names all start with perl- instead of c- but work the
same as their C mode cousins.  These include
¬perl-align-contin-lines≈perl-align-contin-lines, ¬perl-brace-offset≈perl-brace-offset,
¬perl-closeback≈perl-closeback, ¬perl-contin-offset≈perl-contin-offset,
¬perl-label-indent≈perl-label-indent, ¬perl-top-braces≈perl-top-braces,
¬perl-top-contin≈perl-top-contin, ¬perl-top-struct≈perl-top-struct, and
¬perl-topindent≈perl-topindent.  Set ¬perl-tab-override≈perl-tab-override if you want
Epsilon to assume that tab characters in Perl files aren't always 8
characters wide.  Set ¬perl-indent≈perl-indent if you want to use an
indentation in Perl files that's not equal to one tab stop.

When the cursor is on a brace, bracket, or parenthesis, Epsilon will
try to locate its matching brace, bracket, or parenthesis, and
highlight them both.  If the current character has no match, Epsilon
will not highlight it.  Set the variable
¬auto-show-perl-delimiters≈auto-show-perl-delimiters to zero to disable this feature.

When you yank blocks of text into a buffer in Perl mode, Epsilon can
automatically reindent it.  Set the variable
¬reindent-after-perl-yank≈reindent-after-perl-yank nonzero to enable this behavior.
Some Perl syntax is sensitive to indentation, and Epsilon's indenter
may change the indentation, so you should examine yanked text to make
sure it hasn't changed.

Press Alt-' to display a list of all subroutines defined in the
current file.  You can move to a definition in the list and press
⁄Enter€ and Epsilon will go to that definition, or press Ctrl-G
to remain at the starting point.

3PostScript Mode

PostScript modeEpsilon automatically enters PostScript mode
when you read a file with an extension of .ps.  In PostScript mode,
Epsilon does appropriate syntax highlighting, recognizing text
strings, comments, and literals like /Name.

When the cursor is on a brace, bracket, or parenthesis, Epsilon will
try to locate its matching brace, bracket, or parenthesis, and
highlight them both.  If the current character has no match, Epsilon
will not highlight it.  Set the variable
¬auto-show-postscript-delimiters≈auto-show-postscript-delimiters to zero to disable this
feature.

3Shell Mode

shell modeEpsilon automatically enters shell mode when you
read a file with an extension of .sh or .csh, or when you read a file
with no extension that starts with a #! line mentioning a shell
like sh, csh, or bash.  In Shell mode, Epsilon does appropriate
syntax highlighting, recognizing comments, variables and strings.

In Shell mode, Epsilon uses a tab size setting specified by the
¬shell-tab-override≈shell-tab-override variable.

When the cursor is on a brace, bracket, or parenthesis, Epsilon will
try to locate its matching brace, bracket, or parenthesis, and
highlight them both.  If the current character has no match, Epsilon
will not highlight it.  Set the variable
¬auto-show-shell-delimiters≈auto-show-shell-delimiters to zero to disable this feature.


shell-mode


3TeX Mode

TeX modeEpsilon automatically enters TeX mode when you read a
file with an extension of .tex, .ltx, or .sty.

Keys in TeX mode include Alt-i for italic text, Alt-Shift-I for
slanted text, Alt-Shift-T for typewriter, Alt-Shift-B for boldface,
Alt-Shift-C for small caps, Alt-Shift-F for a footnote, and Alt-s for
a centered line.  Alt-Shift-E prompts for the name of a LaTeX
environment, then inserts ¥beginµ»env…∂ and ¥endµ»env…∂ lines for the one you select.  You can press ? to
select an environment from a list.  (The list of environments comes
from the file latex.env, which you can edit.)

For most of these commands, you can highlight a block of text first
and Epsilon will make the text italic, slanted, etc. or you can use
the command and then type the text to be italic, slanted, etc.

By default, Epsilon inserts the appropriate LaTeX 2e/3 command (such
as ¥textit for italic text).  Set the variable
¬latex-2e-or-3≈latex-2e-or-3 to 0 if you want Epsilon to use the LaTeX
2.09 equivalent.  (In the case of italic text, this would be
¥it.)

The keys "µ" and "$" insert matched pairs of characters (either
µ∂ or $$).  When you type ¥( or ¥[, TeX mode will
insert a matching ¥) or ¥], respectively.  But if
you type "µ" just before a non-whitespace character, it inserts
only a "µ".  This makes it easier to surround existing text with
braces.

The keys ⁄Comma€ and ⁄Period€ remove a preceding italic
correction ¥/, the " key inserts the appropriate kind of
doublequote sequence like `` or '', and Alt-" inserts an
actual " character.

Some TeX mode commands are slightly different in LaTeX than in pure
TeX.  Set ¬tex-force-latex≈tex-force-latex to 1 if all your documents are
LaTeX, 0 if all your documents are TeX, or 2 if Epsilon
should determine this on a document-by-document basis.  In that case,
Epsilon will assume a document is LaTeX if it contains a ¥beginµdocument∂ statement or if it's in a file with an
.ltx extension.  By default, Epsilon assumes all documents use LaTeX.

When the cursor is on a curly brace or square bracket character like
µ, ∂, [, or ], Epsilon will try to locate its matching character
and highlight them both.  If the current character has no match,
Epsilon will not highlight it.  Set the variable
¬auto-show-tex-delimiters≈auto-show-tex-delimiters to zero to disable this feature.

Set the variable ¬tex-look-back≈tex-look-back to a bigger number if you want
TeX mode to more accurately syntax highlight very large paragraphs
but be slower, or a smaller number if you want recoloring to be
faster but perhaps miscolor large paragraphs.

The compile-buffer command uses the ¬compile-tex-cmd≈compile-tex-cmd
variable in this mode.

DVI files, previewingIf your TeX system uses a compatible DVI
previewer, then you can use Epsilon's ¬jump-to-dvi command to
see the DVI output resulting from the current line of TeX.  This
requires some setup so that the DVI file contains TeX source file
line number data.  See the description of jump-to-dvi for
details.

2More Programming Features

Epsilon has a number of features that are useful when programming,
but work similarly regardless of the programming language.  These are
described in the following sections.  Also see the language-specific
commands described in previous sections.

3Accessing Help

hlp
fileskeyword helpcompiler helpAPI helpThis section describes how Epsilon can help you access
compiler help files and similar external documentation.  See Rhelpπhelp for directions on obtaining help on Epsilon itself.

Epsilon for Unix provides a ¬man command for reading man pages.
At its prompt, type anything you would normally type to the man
command, such as -k open to get a list of man pages related to
the keyword "open".  If you don't use any flags or section names,
Epsilon will provide completion on available topics.  For example,
type "?" to see all man page topics available.  Within man page
output, you can double-click on a reference to another man page, such
as echo(1), or press ⁄Enter€ to follow it, or press m to be
prompted for another man page topic.

gui.mnu fileepswhlp.cnt fileYou can set up Epsilon for Windows to search for help on a
programming language construct (like an API function or a C++
keyword) in a series of help files.  Run the Select Help Files...
command on the help menu to select the help files you want to use.
This command adds help files to the Help menu, to the context menu
that the secondary mouse button displays, and to the list of files
searched by the Search All Help Files... command on the help menu.
The last command is only available under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT
(3.51 and later).  Edit the file gui.mnu to
further modify the contents of Epsilon's menus.  Edit the file
epswhlp.cnt to modify the list of files
searched by Search All Help Files.

If you highlight a word in the buffer before running a help command,
Epsilon will search for help on that keyword.  Otherwise Epsilon will
display either a list of available keywords or the table of contents
for the help file you selected.

3Commenting Commands

commenting commandsRcommentingThe Alt-; command
creates a comment on the current line, using the commenting style of
the current language mode.  The comment begins at the column
specified by the ¬comment-column≈comment-column variable (by default 40).
(However, if the comment is the first thing on the line and
¬indent-comment-as-code≈indent-comment-as-code is nonzero, it indents to the column
specified by the buffer's language-specific indentation function.)
If the line already has a comment, this command moves the comment to
the comment column.

With a numeric argument, Alt-; searches for the next comment in the
buffer and goes to its start.  With a negative argument, Alt-;
searches backwards for a comment.  Press Alt-; again to reindent the
comment.

By default (and in modes that don't specify a commenting style),
comments begin with the ; character and continue to the end of the
line.  C mode recognizes both old-style /* */ comments, and the newer
C++-style comments //, and by default creates the former.  Set the
variable ¬new-c-comments≈new-c-comments to 1, if you want Alt-; to create
new-style comments.

The Ctrl-X ; command sets future comments to begin at the current
column.  With a positive argument, it sets the comment column based on
the indentation of the previous comment in the buffer.
If the current line has a comment, this command reindents it.

With a negative argument (as in Alt-⁄Minus€ Ctrl-X ;), the Ctrl-X ;
command doesn't change the comment column at all.  Instead, it kills
any comment on the current line.  The command saves the comment in a
kill buffer.

The comment commands look for comments using regular expression
patterns (see Rregexπregex) contained in the buffer-specific
variables ¬comment-pattern≈comment-pattern (which should match the whole
comment) and ¬comment-start≈comment-start (which should match the sequence
that begins a comment, like "/*").  When creating a comment, it
inserts the contents of the buffer-specific variables
¬comment-begin≈comment-begin and ¬comment-end≈comment-end around the new comment.
When Epsilon puts a buffer in C mode, it decides how to set these
variables based on the new-c-comments variable.

RcommentfillIn C and Perl modes, Epsilon normally auto-fills
text in block comments as you type, breaking overly long lines.  See
the ¬c-auto-fill-mode≈c-auto-fill-mode variable.  As with normal auto-fill mode
(see Rfillingπfilling), use Ctrl-X F to set the right margin
for filling.  Set the ¬c-fill-column≈c-fill-column variable to change the
default right margin in C and Perl mode buffers.

You can manually refill the current paragraph in a block comment by
pressing Alt-q.  If you provide a numeric prefix argument to Alt-q,
say by typing Alt-2 Alt-q, it will fill using the current column as
the right margin.  By default, Epsilon doesn't apply auto-filling to
a comment line that also contains non-comment text (such as a C
statement with a comment after it on the same line).  Use Alt-q to
break such lines.

2Fixing Mistakes
3Undoing

RundoThe ¬undo command on F9 undoes the last
command, restoring the previous contents of the buffer, or moving point
to its position, as if you hadn't done the last command.  If you
press F9 again, Epsilon will undo the command before that, and
so forth.

For convenience, when typing text Epsilon treats each word you
type as a single command, rather than treating each character as its
own command.  For example, if you typed the previous paragraph
and pressed undo, Epsilon would remove the text "forth.".  If you
pressed ¬undo again, Epsilon would remove "so ".

Epsilon's undo mechanism considers each subcommand of a complicated
command such as query-replace a separate command.  For
example, suppose you do a query-replace, and one-by-one
replace ten occurrences of a string.  The undo command would
then reverse the replacements one at a time.

Epsilon remembers changes to each buffer separately.  Say you changed
buffer 1, then changed buffer 2, then returned to buffer 1.  Undoing now
would undo the last change you made to buffer 1, leaving buffer 2
alone.  If you switched to buffer 2 and invoked undo, Epsilon would
then undo changes to that buffer.

The ¬redo command on F10 puts your changes back in (it undoes
the last undo).  If you press undo five times, then press redo four
times, the buffer would appear the same as if you pressed undo only
once.

You can move back and forth undoing and redoing in this way.
However, if you invoke a command (other than undo or
redo) that either changes the buffer or moves point, you can
not redo any commands undone immediately before that
command.  For example, if you type "one two three", undo the
"three", and type "four" instead, Epsilon will behave as if you
had typed "one two four" all along, and will let you undo only
that.

undo vs. undo-changesredo vs. redo-changesThe
commands ¬undo-changes and ¬redo-changes work like
undo and redo, except they will automatically undo or
redo all changes to the buffer that involve only movements of point,
and stop just before a change of actual buffer contents.

For example, when you invoke undo-changes, it performs an
undo, then continues to undo changes that involve only
movements of point.  The undo-changes command will either
undo a single buffer modification (as opposed to movement of point),
as a plain undo command would, or a whole series of movement
commands at once.  It doesn't undo any movement commands after
undoing a buffer modification, only after undoing other movement
commands.  The ¬redo-changes command works similarly.

The Ctrl-F9 key runs undo-changes, and the Ctrl-F10 key runs
redo-changes.

The buffer-specific variable ¬undo-size≈undo-size determines, in part,
how many commands Epsilon can remember.  For example, if
undo-size has the value 500,000 (the default), Epsilon will
save at most 500,000 characters of deleted or changed text for each
buffer.  Each buffer may have its own value for this variable.
Epsilon also places an internal limit on the number of commands,
related to command complexity.  Versions of Epsilon for Windows
95/98/NT and Unix can typically remember about 10,000 simple commands
(ignoring any limit imposed by undo-size) but more complicated
commands make the number smaller.  For other versions the per-buffer
limit is around 500 - 1500 commands.

3Interrupting a Command

abort keycanceling a commandScroll Lock keyRabortcmd
You can interrupt a command by pressing
Ctrl-G, the default ªabort keyº.  For example, you can use Ctrl-G
to stop an incremental search on a very long file if you don't feel
like waiting.  You can set the abort key with the ¬set-abort-key
command.  If you interrupt Epsilon while reading a file from disk or
writing a file to disk, it will ask you whether you want to abort or
continue.  Typing the abort key also cancels any currently executing
keyboard macros.

In the DOS version, the ⁄Scroll Lock€ key also acts like the abort
key.

Aborting normally only works when a command checks for it.  When
writing a new command in EEL, you may wish to stop it even though it
contains no checks for aborting.  In the DOS version, you may use the
Control-⁄Scroll Lock€ key to start the EEL debugger.  You can
then press ⁄Scroll Lock€ to abort from the command.  As with
⁄Scroll Lock€, you cannot bind a command to the
Control-⁄Scroll Lock€ key.

In the OS/2 version of Epsilon, pressing Control-⁄Scroll Lock€ makes
a list of options appear at the bottom.  You can choose to start the
EEL debugger, abort the current command, exit the editor immediately
(without warning if your buffers contain unsaved changes), or
do nothing.

2The Screen
3Display Commands

moving aroundThe Ctrl-L command causes Epsilon to center point
in the window.  If you give a numeric argument to Ctrl-L, Epsilon
makes the current line appear on that line of the window.  For
instance, give a numeric argument of zero to make the current line
appear on the topmost line of the window.  (The ¬line-to-top
command is another way to do this.)  If you give a numeric argument
greater than the number of lines the window occupies, Epsilon will
position the current line at the bottom of the window.  (The
¬line-to-bottom command is another way to do this.)  When
repeated, the Ctrl-L command also completely refreshes the screen.
If some other program has written text on the screen, or something
has happened to garble the screen, use this command to refresh it.

The Alt-⁄Comma€ and Alt-⁄Period€ commands move point to the
first and last positions displayed on the window, respectively.

The Ctrl-Z and Alt-Z commands scroll the text in the window up or
down, respectively, by one line.  These scrolling commands will move
point as necessary so that point remains visible in the window.

The Ctrl-V and Alt-V commands scroll the text of the window up or down,
respectively, by several lines fewer than the size of the window.
These commands move point to the center line of the window.

You can control the exact amount of overlap between the original
window of text and the new window with the ¬window-overlap≈window-overlap
variable.  A positive value for this variable means to use
that number of screen lines of overlap between one window of text
and the next (or previous).  A negative value for
window-overlap represents a percentage of overlap, instead of
the number of screen lines.  For example, the default value for
window-overlap of 2 means to use 2 lines of overlap.  A value
of -25 for window-overlap means to overlap by 25%.

You can change how Epsilon pages through a file by
setting the variable paging-centers-window.  Epsilon normally
positions the cursor on the center line of the window as you move
from page to page.  Set this variable to zero if you want Epsilon to
try to keep the cursor on the same screen line as it pages.

line number, positioning byThe ¬goto-line command on
Ctrl-X G prompts for a line number and then goes to the beginning of
that line in the current buffer.  If you prefix a numeric argument,
Epsilon will use that as the line number.  Use the format 10:20
to include a column specification; that one goes to line 10, column
number 20.  Or use a percent character to indicate a buffer
percentage: 25% goes to a line 25% of the way through the
buffer.

line number, displayingThe Ctrl-X L command shows the number
of lines in the buffer and the number of the line containing point.
It also shows the number of bytes the file would occupy if written to
disk.  This can differ from the size of the buffer, because the
latter counts each line separator as a single character.  Such
characters require two bytes when written to disk in the format used
in Windows, DOS, and OS/2, however.  See Rtranslatenlπtranslatenl
for information on how Epsilon translates line separator characters.

The Ctrl-X = command displays in the echo area information
pertaining to point.  It shows the size of the buffer, the
character position in the buffer corresponding to point, that
character's column, and the value of that character in decimal,
hex, and "normal" character representation.

3Horizontal Scrolling

horizontal scrollinglong linesline wrappingwrapping, linesline scrollingscrolling, linesRscrollmodeThe Alt-{ and Alt-} commands
scroll the text in the window to the left or right, respectively, by
one column.

The Alt-{ and Alt-} commands also control how Epsilon displays
long lines to you.  Epsilon can, for display purposes, wrap long
lines to the next line.  Epsilon indicates a wrapped line by
displaying a special continuation character where it broke the line
for display purposes.  But by default Epsilon displays long lines by
simply scrolling them off the display.  To switch from scrolling long
lines to wrapping long lines, use the Alt-} command to scroll to
the right, past the end.  Epsilon will then wrap long lines.

Similarly, to switch from wrapping long lines to scrolling long
lines, press the Alt-{ key.  Subsequent use of the Alt-{
command will then scroll the text in the window to the left, as
explained above.  Whenever Epsilon changes from one display scheme to
the other, it indicates the change in the echo area.  If, due to
scrolling, some of a buffer's contents would appear past the left
edge of the screen, the mode line displays "<»number…" to
indicate the number of columns hidden to the left.

You can also use the ¬change-line-wrapping command to set whether
Epsilon wraps long lines in the current window, or horizontally
scrolls across them.

If you want Epsilon to always wrap long lines, set the default value
of the window-specific variable ¬display-column≈display-column to -1 using
the set-variable command on F8, then save the state using the
write-state command on Ctrl-F3.

In a dialog, another way to handle lines that are too long to fit in
a window is to resize the dialog by moving its borders.  Most dialogs
in Epsilon for Windows are resizable, and Epsilon will remember the
new size from session to session.

The Alt-PageUp and Alt-PageDown keys scroll horizontally, like Ctrl-V
and Alt-V.  More precisely, they move the point left or right on the
current line by about half the width of the current window, then
reposition the window so the point is visible.  The command
¬jump-to-column on Alt-g prompts for a column number, then goes
to the specified column.

3Windows

RwindowsEpsilon has quite a few commands to deal with
creating, changing, and moving windows.  Changing the size or number
of the windows never affects the buffers they display.

Normally, each buffer has a single point, but this can prove
inconvenient when a buffer appears in more than one window.  For this
reason, Epsilon associates a point with each window in that case.
Consequently, you can look at different parts of the same buffer by
having the same buffer displayed in different windows and moving
around independently in each of them.

4Creating Windows

 KCtrl-X 5 KCtrl-X 2windows, creatingThe Ctrl-X 2 command splits the current window into two windows, one on
top of the other, each about half as large.  Each window displays the
same buffer that the original did.  This command will only split the
window if each new window would occupy at least 1 screen line, not
counting the mode line.  To edit another file in a new window, first
use Ctrl-X 2, then use one of the file commands described in Rfilecmdsπfilecmds.

The Ctrl-X 5 command works similarly, but splits the current window
so that the two child windows appear side by side, instead of
stacked.  This command will only split the window if each new window
would occupy at least 1 column.  Since this typically results in
narrow windows, the Ctrl-X 5 command also sets up the windows to
scroll long lines, as described in Rscrollmodeπscrollmode.

4Removing Windows

 KCtrl-X Z KCtrl-X 1 KCtrl-X Ctrl-D KCtrl-X 0windows, deletingTo get rid of the current window, use the Ctrl-X 0 command.
If the previous window can move into the deleted window's space, it
does.  Otherwise, the next window expands into the deleted window's space.

The Ctrl-X 1 command makes the current window occupy the entire screen,
deleting all the other windows.  The Ctrl-X Z command operates like
Ctrl-X 1, except that it also remembers the current window configuration.
Later, if you type Ctrl-X Z again, the command restores the saved
window configuration.

4Selecting Windows

windows, selectingThe Ctrl-X N key moves to the next window,
wrapping around to the first window if invoked from the last window.
The Ctrl-X P key does the reverse: it moves to the previous window,
wrapping around to the last window if invoked from the first window.
In most environments you can also use Ctrl-⁄Tab€ to move to the
next window, and Shift-Ctrl-⁄Tab€ to move to the previous one.

You can think of the window order as the position of a window
in a list of windows.  Initially only one window appears in the list.
When you split a window, the two child windows replace it in the
list.  The top or left window comes before the bottom or right
window.  When you delete a window, that window leaves the list.

You can also change windows with the ¬move-to-window command.
It takes a cue from the last key in the sequence used to invoke it,
and moves to a window in the direction indicated by the key.  If you
invoke the command with Ctrl-X ⁄Right€, for example, the window
to the right of the cursor becomes the new current window.  The
Ctrl-X ⁄Left€ key moves left, Ctrl-X ⁄Up€ moves up, and
Ctrl-X ⁄Down€ moves down.  If key doesn't correspond to a
direction, the command asks for a direction key.

4Resizing Windows

windows, sizingThe easiest way to resize Epsilon windows
is to use the mouse.  But Epsilon also provides various ways to do
this via the keyboard.

The Ctrl-X + key runs the command ¬enlarge-window-interactively.
After you invoke the command, point to a window border using
the arrow keys.  The indicated window border moves so as to make
the current window larger.  You can keep pressing arrow keys to
enlarge the window.  To switch from enlarging to shrinking,
press the minus key.  The command Ctrl-X - works like Ctrl-X +, but
starts out shrinking instead of enlarging.  Whenever the window
looks the right size, press ⁄Enter€ to leave the command.

You can use several other Epsilon commands to resize windows.  The
Ctrl-⁄PgUp€ key enlarges the current window vertically, and the
Ctrl-⁄PgDn€ key shrinks the current window vertically.  They do this
by moving the mode line of the window above them up or down, if
possible.  Otherwise, the current window's mode line moves up or
down, as appropriate.

You can also enlarge and shrink windows horizontally.  The
¬enlarge-window-horizontally command on Ctrl-X @ enlarges the
current window by one column horizontally and the
¬shrink-window-horizontally command shrinks it.  They do this by
moving the left boundary of the current window left or right, if
possible.  Otherwise, the current window's right boundary moves, as
appropriate.  You can use a numeric prefix with these commands to
adjust by more than one line or column, or in the opposite direction.

3Customizing the Screen

hex displaydisplaying special
characterscontrol charactersgraphics
characterstab size, settingRset-show-graphicRsettabsizeEpsilon displays tabs in a
file by moving over to the next tab stop column.  Epsilon normally
spaces tabs every four columns.  You can change the tab stop spacing
by setting the variable ¬tab-size≈tab-size.  Another method is to use
the ¬set-tab-size command, but this can only set the tab size in
the current buffer.  To change the default value for new buffers, set
the variable using the set-variable command.

Many indenting commands take the tab size into account when they
indent using spaces and tabs.  See Rindentingπindenting for
information on the indenting commands.

Epsilon can display special characters in four
ways.  Epsilon normally displays control characters with a ^
prefix indicating a control character (except for the few control
characters like ^I that have a special meaning--^I, for
example, means ⁄Tab€).  It displays other characters, including
international characters, with their graphic symbol.

In mode 0, Epsilon displays Meta characters (characters with the 8th
bit on) by prefixing to them a "M-", e.g., Meta C appears as
"M-C".  Epsilon display Control-meta characters by prefixing to
them "M-^", e.g., "M-^C".  Epsilon displays most control
characters by prefixing to them a caret, e.g., Control C appears as
"^C".

In mode 1, Epsilon displays graphic symbols for all control
characters and meta characters, instead of using a prefix as in ^A (except for the few that have a special meaning, like ⁄Tab€ or
⁄Newline€).

In mode 2, Epsilon displays control and meta characters by their
hexadecimal ASCII values, with an "x" before them to indicate hex.

In mode 3, which is the default, Epsilon displays control characters
as "^C", and uses the graphic symbol for other characters, as
described above.

The ¬set-show-graphic command on Ctrl-F6 cycles among these four
modes of representation.  Providing a numeric argument of 0, 1, 2, or
3 selects the corresponding mode.

The command ¬change-show-spaces on Shift-F6 makes spaces, tabs,
and newline characters in the buffer visible, by using special
graphic characters for each.  Pressing it again makes these
characters invisible.  The command sets the buffer-specific variable
¬show-spaces≈show-spaces.

Epsilon will usually display a message in the echo area for at least
one second before replacing it with a new message.  You can set
this time with the ¬see-delay≈see-delay variable.  It contains the number of
hundredths of a second that a message must remain visible, before a
subsequent message can overwrite it.  Whenever you press a key with
messages pending, Epsilon skips right
to the last message and puts that up.  (Epsilon doesn't stop working
just because it can't put up a message; it just remembers to put the
message up later.)

RcursorshapeUnder DOS and OS/2, you can set variables to
modify the text cursor shape Epsilon displays in different
situations.  Epsilon gets the cursor shape from one of four
variables, depending upon whether or not Epsilon is in overwrite
mode, and whether or not the cursor is positioned in virtual space.
(See the description of the virtual-space variable in Rvirtualspaceπvirtual-space.)

Ω– 2 c30 c52 VariableIn overwrite mode?In virtual space?¬normal-cursor≈normal-cursorNoNo¬overwrite-cursor≈overwrite-cursorYesNo¬virtual-insert-cursor≈virtual-insert-cursorNoYes¬virtual-overwrite-cursor≈virtual-overwrite-cursorYesYes—æ

Each of these variables contains a code that specifies the top and
bottom edges of the cursor, such as 3006, which specifies a cursor
that begins on scan line 3 and extends to scan line 6 on a character
box.  The topmost scan line is scan line 0.

Scan lines above 50 in a cursor shape code are interpreted
differently.  A scan line number of 99 indicates the highest-numbered
valid scan line (just below the character), 98 indicates the line
above that, and so forth.  For example, a cursor shape like 1098
produces a cursor that extends from scan line 1 to the next-to-last
scan line, one scan line smaller at top and bottom than a full block
cursor.

caretThe Windows and X versions of Epsilon use a similar set
of variables to control the shape of the cursor (or caret, in Windows
terminology).

Ω– 2 c32 c54 VariableIn overwrite mode?In virtual space?¬normal-gui-cursor≈normal-gui-cursorNoNo¬overwrite-gui-cursor≈overwrite-gui-cursorYesNo¬virtual-insert-gui-cursor≈virtual-insert-gui-cursorNoYes¬virtual-overwrite-gui-cursor≈virtual-overwrite-gui-cursorYesYes—æ

Each variable contains a code that specifies the height and width of
the caret, expressed as a percentage of the character dimensions.
Values close to 0 or 100 are absolute pixel counts, so a
width of 98 is two pixels smaller than a character.  A width of
exactly zero means use the default width.  All measurements are from
the top left corner of the character.  In EEL programs, you can use
the πMCURSOR_SHAPE( ) macro to combine the height and width values
into the appropriate code; it simply multiplies the height by 1000
and adds it to the width.  So the default caret shape of
CURSOR_SHAPE(100, 2), which specifies a height of 100% of the
character size and a width of 2 pixels, is encoded as the value
100,002.  The value 100,100 represents a block cursor.

Epsilon for Windows can draw a rectangle around the current line to
increase its visibility and make it easier to find the cursor.  Set
the ¬draw-focus-rectangle≈draw-focus-rectangle variable nonzero to enable this.  Set
the ¬draw-column-marker≈draw-column-marker variable if you want Epsilon for
Windows to draw a vertical line at a particular column (specified by
this variable), to make it easier to edit text that may not go past a
certain column.  (Also see auto-fill mode described in Rfillingπfilling.)

Rset-display-charactersThe ¬set-display-characters
command lets you alter the various characters that Epsilon uses to
construct its display.  These include the line-drawing characters
that form window borders, the characters Epsilon uses in some of the
display modes set by set-show-graphic, the characters it uses
to construct the scroll bar, and the characters Epsilon replaces for
the graphical mouse cursor it normally uses in DOS.  The command
displays a matrix of possible characters, and guides you through the
selection process.

3Fonts

fonts, settingRfontsThe ¬set-font command changes
the font Epsilon for Windows uses, by displaying a font dialog box
and letting you pick a new font.  Modifying the ¬font-fixed≈font-fixed
variable is another way to set the font.  (The above applies to
Epsilon for Unix as well, when it runs as an X program.)

You can specify a specific font for use in printing with the
¬set-printer-font command.  Similarly, the ¬set-dialog-font
command lets you specify what font to use for Epsilon's dialog
windows (like the one bufed displays).  There are also
corresponding variables ¬font-printer≈font-printer and ¬font-dialog≈font-dialog.

The command ¬change-font-size supplements set-font by
providing additional font choices.  Some Windows fonts include a
variety of character cell widths for a given character cell height.
(For example, many of the font selections available in windowed DOS
sessions use multiple widths.)  Commands like set-font
utilize the standard Windows font dialog, which doesn't provide any
way to select these alternate widths.  The change-font-size
command lets you choose these fonts.

The change-font-size command doesn't change the font name, or
toggle bold or italic.  You'll need to use the set-font
command to do that.

Instead, change-font-size lets you adjust the height and
width of the current font using the arrow keys.  You can abort to
restore the old font settings, or press ⁄Enter€ or ⁄Space€ to
keep them.  This is a handy way to shrink or expand the font size.  A
width or height of 0 means use a suitable default.

3Setting Colors

color classcolor schemesetting, colorscolors, changingRcolclassRset-color
This section describes how to set colors in Epsilon.  Epsilon comes
with many built-in color schemes.  Each ªcolor schemeº tells
Epsilon what color to use for each ªcolor classº.
Color classes correspond to the
different parts of the screen.  There are separate color classes for
normal text, highlighted text, text in the echo area,
syntax-highlighted comments, and so forth.  (See below for a partial
list.)

You can select a different color scheme using the ¬set-color
command.  In Epsilon for Unix under X, simply pick a new color scheme
from the list.  In other versions of Epsilon, use the F and B keys to
move forward and backward in the list of color schemes, or select a
new one with the mouse.

Epsilon remembers the name of one color scheme for use on color
displays, and a separate scheme for monochrome displays.  Epsilon for
Windows remembers its selected scheme separately, so you can select
one color scheme to use in Epsilon for Windows, and a different
scheme in Epsilon for DOS.  When you've turned off window borders
with the toggle-borders command, Epsilon uses color schemes
with particular, fixed names.  See Rtogglebordersπtoggle-borders.

When Epsilon for Unix runs as an X program, it uses the same scheme
settings as Epsilon for Windows.  When it runs as a terminal program,
it uses the same color or monochrome scheme as the DOS and OS/2
versions.  One exception: When Epsilon runs as a terminal program and
notices that the TERM environment variable is set to xterm, it uses a
special color scheme that's designed to inherit the background and
foreground colors of the underlying xterm.

Use the set-color command to select a color scheme from the
list of available color schemes.  You can also customize a color
scheme by selecting one, selecting a color class within it, and using
the buttons to select a different foreground or background color.

The Unix, DOS, and OS/2 versions of set-color use a slightly
different user interface than the Windows version.  In those
versions, you can select the color scheme in the Color Scheme window
with the F and B keys.  Then select the particular color class you
want to modify by pressing the N and P keys.  Finally, use the arrow
keys to move about in the matrix of color combinations that Epsilon
displays.  You can also select a color scheme, color class, or color
combination with the mouse.

Another method of customizing a color scheme is to create an EEL file
like stdcolor.e.  The file stdcolor.e defines all Epsilon's built-in
color schemes.  You can use one of these as a model for your own
color scheme.  See Rcolorschemeπcolorscheme for the syntax of color
scheme definitions.

After you have defined a color scheme using set-color, you
may wish to save it to a file in a human-readable format.  (You'll
need to do this to transfer the modified color scheme to a different
version of Epsilon.)  The ¬export-colors command builds an EEL
file named mycolors.e that contains all Epsilon's current color
definitions for the current color scheme.  (With a numeric argument,
it lists all schemes.)

The DOS, OS/2, and Unix terminal versions of Epsilon are limited to
the sixteen standard colors for foreground and background, for a
total of 256 possible color combinations, while Epsilon for Windows
(and Epsilon for Unix, as an X program) have no such limitation.
Internally, all versions of Epsilon store 32 bits of color
information for the foreground and background of each color class.
The DOS, OS/2 and Unix terminal versions convert back to 4 bits of
foreground and background when displaying text.

On EGA and VGA systems, Epsilon for DOS or OS/2 provides eight high
intensity background colors in addition to the standard eight
background colors, for a total of 256 possible foreground/background
combinations.  The variable ¬selectable-colors≈selectable-colors controls the
number of colors the set-color command lets you select from.
Epsilon sets it to 256 instead of 128 on appropriate systems.  The
command still only displays 128 combinations at a time.  The ⁄Up€
and ⁄Down€ keys flip to the other 128 possibilities, or use the
mouse to scroll the color window.

text color classThe set-color command displays a short description of each
color class as you select it.  Here we describe a few of the color
classes in more detail:
Œtext Epsilon puts the text of an ordinary buffer in
this color.  But if Epsilon is doing code coloring in a buffer, it
uses the color classes defined for code coloring instead.  For C,
C++, Java, and EEL files, these all start with "c-" and appear
farther down in the list of color classes.

mode-line color classŒmode-line Epsilon uses this color for the text in the
mode line of a tiled window.

horiz-border color classŒhoriz-border Epsilon uses this color for the line
part of the mode line of a tiled window.

vert-border color classŒvert-border Epsilon uses this color for the vertical
border it draws between tiled windows.

after-exiting color classŒafter-exiting Epsilon for DOS or OS/2 tries to leave
the screen in this color when you exit.  Under DOS, Epsilon sets this
color when it starts up, based on the screen's colors before you
started Epsilon.  Set the ¬restore-color-on-exit≈restore-color-on-exit variable to
zero to disable this behavior, so you can set the color explicitly
and preserve the change in your state file.

debug-text color classŒdebug-text The EEL debugger uses this color when it
displays EEL source code.

default color classŒdefault Epsilon initializes any newly-defined color
classes (see Rcolclassπcolclass) with this color.

screen-border color classŒscreen-border On VGA displays, Epsilon for DOS or
OS/2 sets the border area around the screen to match this color's
background.  Epsilon only uses the background part of this color; the
foreground part doesn't matter.

3Code Coloring

c-ident color classcode
coloringsyntax highlightingRcode-coloringEpsilon does syntax-based highlighting of C, C++, Java, and EEL
files.  Set the buffer-specific variable ¬want-code-coloring≈want-code-coloring to
0 to disable this feature or run the change-code-coloring
command.  To change the colors Epsilon uses, see the previous section.

If you use a slower computer, you may need to tell Epsilon to do less
code coloring, in order to get acceptable response time.  Set the
variable ¬minimal-coloring≈minimal-coloring to 1 to tell Epsilon to look
only for comments, preprocessor lines, strings, and character
constants when coloring.  Epsilon will color all identifiers,
functions, keywords, numbers and punctuation the same, using the
c-ident color class for all.  This makes code coloring much
faster.

When Epsilon begins coloring in the middle of a buffer, it has to
determine whether it's inside a comment by searching back for comment
characters.  If you edit extremely large C files with few block
comments, you can speed up Epsilon by telling it not to search so
far.  Set the variable ¬color-look-back≈color-look-back to the number of
characters Epsilon should search through before giving up.  Any block
comments larger than this value may not be colored correctly.  A
value of zero (the default) lets Epsilon search as far as it needs to,
and correctly colors comments of any size.

When Epsilon isn't busy acting on your keystrokes, it looks through
the current buffer and assigns colors to the individual regions of
text, so that Epsilon responds faster as you scroll through the
buffer.  For smoother performance, Epsilon doesn't begin to do this
until it's been idle for a certain period of time, contained in the
¬idle-coloring-delay≈idle-coloring-delay variable.  This holds the number of
hundredths of a second to wait before computing more coloring
information.  By default, it's 100, so Epsilon waits one second.
Set it to -1 to disable background code coloring.

Normally Epsilon colors buffers as needed.  You can set Epsilon to
instead color the entire buffer the first time it's displayed.  Set
the variable ¬color-whole-buffer≈color-whole-buffer to the size of the largest
buffer you want Epsilon to entirely color at once.

3Video Display Modes

video modesRdisplaymodesREGAUnder DOS and OS/2, Epsilon supports
the special video display modes available with EGA and VGA boards.
These allow you to display more characters on the screen than the
standard 80 columns and 25 lines.  The ¬next-video command on
Ctrl-F5 switches to a different video mode, if it can.  It will
eventually cycle through all the video modes.  The ¬set-video
command on Alt-F5 asks for the name of a particular video mode,
providing completion.  Video modes have names like
80x25.

On EGA boards, Epsilon for DOS provides 80x25, 80x35, and 80x43
modes.  On VGA boards, Epsilon provides 80x25, 80x28, 80x35, 80x40,
and 80x50 modes.  Most VGA boards can switch to 80x43 mode as well,
but some can't.  Under DOS, Epsilon will assume that your VGA board
can't do 80x43 mode, unless you set the variable ¬vga43≈vga43 to a
nonzero value.

Under OS/2, complications caused by incompatible boards don't occur.
Epsilon provides 80x25 and 80x43 to EGA users, and 80x25, 80x30,
80x43, 80x50, and 80x60 to VGA users.

VESA video modesSVGA, video
modesUltravision video modes132 column videoEpsilon can also support any additional
video modes provided by a VESA Super VGA TSR or BIOS.  Super VGA
display boards often come with VESA support built in, or supplied as
a TSR program you can load in your config.sys or autoexec.bat file.
You can set the variable ¬extra-video-modes≈extra-video-modes to 3 to let Epsilon
look for any video modes the Super VGA program provides, and add them
to the list of available modes.  Typically these include 132
column modes.  (You can see the full list by
pressing Alt-F5, then pressing "?".)  Epsilon only checks for
video modes when it starts, so you must set this variable, save it
using the write-state command on Alt-F3, exit Epsilon and
restart to begin using these modes.

Epsilon also detects and supports the Ultravision TSR by Personics
Corporation.  The video modes it provides replace those built into
Epsilon.  If an Ultravision TSR and a VESA Super VGA TSR are both
present, the Ultravision TSR takes precedence.  For Epsilon to use
the Ultravision TSR, it must be version 1.20 or later, and you must
set ¬extra-video-modes≈extra-video-modes as above.

If you need to disable Epsilon's support of VESA SVGA or Ultravision
TSR's for any reason, you can set the variable
¬extra-video-modes≈extra-video-modes back to 0.  See the description of this
variable in Rextravideomodesπextra-video-modes for details.  Epsilon
needs to load the file vidextra.b to support these additional modes.
If it cannot find this file in the current directory or along the
EPSPATH, it will not be able to switch to any of the additional modes.

You can use the command ¬list-svga-modes to see a list of
modes that were added.  For VESA modes, the command displays
additional information about each mode provided by the VESA driver.

SVGA, OS/2 commandSVGADATA.PMIFor OS/2, run the command
¬list-svga-modes just once to add modes; it will prompt for the
location of the file SVGADATA.PMI, which is
normally in your main ¥OS2 directory.  This is a text file
which describes all the available modes for your video board.  If the
file doesn't exist or is out of date, you can rebuild it by running
the OS/2 command SVGA ON in a full-screen DOS session.  See your
OS/2 documentation for more information on this program.

The list-svga-modes command scans the file SVGADATA.PMI
to determine which video modes are supported by the display board,
and creates an Epsilon definition for each one.  It also displays a
list of all the modes it adds.  You can delete modes you don't want
using the delete-name command: type "video-mode-os2" at its
prompt and then press "?", and you'll see the list of video modes.
When you're satisfied with the list of video modes, you should save
them using the write-state command on Ctrl-F3.

Unlike the DOS version of the list-svga-modes command, the
OS/2 version not only lists the new modes, but also defines them for
Epsilon.  You must run the OS/2 version of this command before
Epsilon can use the extra modes.  Under DOS, on the other hand,
Epsilon loads the new modes automatically each time it starts, so you
don't have to run the list-svga-modes command unless you want
to see the new modes.

If your video board offers additional video modes beyond the standard
ones described above, but there is no VESA SVGA driver available for
it, you can add support for the new modes yourself.  The rest of this
section describes how to make Epsilon support these additional modes.

First, Epsilon for DOS can support only text modes, not graphics modes.
The ROM BIOS must support cursor positioning in that mode, as well.
Epsilon for OS/2 doesn't have these restrictions: if the operating
system supports the mode, you can make Epsilon use it.

The simplest way to use a new mode assumes that the board's
manufacturer provides a program that puts the board in the new mode.
Run that program before you start Epsilon.  Epsilon should
automatically notice and use the screen's new dimensions.  If not,
you can tell Epsilon with the -vl and -vc switches (see Rvlswitchπvlswitch).  (When you start Epsilon, put the name of a
file on its command line.  If you don't include a file name, Epsilon
will try to restore a previous session, including video mode, and
won't use the new screen dimensions.)

Now suppose you want to use the commands described above to switch in
and out of the new mode from within Epsilon.

Under DOS, you can define a new mode without using EEL.
If a numeric variable with a name like
"video-mode-132x60" exists, Epsilon assumes that it contains the value
of a BIOS mode number, and that asking the ROM BIOS to switch to that mode
number will make the screen have those dimensions.  For example, one
EGA-compatible video board will go into 132 by 60 mode when you switch
to mode 99.  If you define a variable with the above name and give it
the value 99, Epsilon will switch in and out of that mode just as it
does with the standard 80 by 43 mode that all EGA boards support.

If this variable technique doesn't work (for example, under OS/2, or
if the BIOS doesn't support the mode), you must write the
screen-switching function in EEL.  Generally, you can do this by
defining an EEL subroutine with a name like "video-mode-132x60".
(In an EEL program, you would write the name
"video_mode_132x60()".  This tells Epsilon that it can use a
mode with 132 columns and 60 lines, and Epsilon will call the
subroutine when it wants to use that mode.  You should examine the
screen-switching functions provided in the file video.e to see how to
do that.  For OS/2, screen-switching functions have names like
"video-mode-os2-132x60".

A screen-switching function takes a numeric parameter that says what
to do.  A value of 1 indicates that the function should switch the
board into the appropriate mode, then return 1.  A value of 0
indicates that the function should prepare to switch the board out of
that mode, prior to switching to another mode, then return 1.  In
either case, the function should return zero if it cannot do the
mode change.  A parameter value of 2 indicates the function should
return 1 (available) or 0 (unavailable) to indicate the current
availability of the mode.  It shouldn't actually change the mode.

3Window Borders

Rtoggle-bordersRset-display-lookUse the command set-display-look to
make Epsilon's window decoration and screen appearance resemble that
of other editors.  It displays a menu of choices.  You can select
Epsilon's original look, Brief's look, the look of the DOS Edit
program (the same as the QBasic program), or the look of the Borland
IDE.

The command ¬toggle-borders removes the
lines separating Epsilon's windows from one another, or restores them.

When there are no window borders, Epsilon provides each window with
its own separate color scheme, in place of the single one selected by
¬set-color.  (You can still use ¬set-color to set the
individual colors in a color scheme, but Epsilon doesn't care which
particular color scheme you select when it displays the contents of
individual windows.  It does use your selected color scheme for other
parts of the screen like the echo area or screen border.)

window-black color classwindow-blue color classThe color schemes Epsilon uses for borderless windows have names like
"window-black", "window-blue" and so forth.
Epsilon assigns them to windows in order.  You can remove one from
consideration using the ¬delete-name command, or create a new
one using EEL (see Rcolorschemeπcolorscheme).

The rest of this section describes some of the variables set by the
above commands.  The set-display-look command in particular
does its work entirely by setting variables.  You can make Epsilon
use a custom display look by setting these variables yourself.  The
variables also allow some customizations not available through the
above commands.

RsbordersRavoidThe ¬echo-line≈echo-line variable contains the number of
the screen line on which to display the echo area.  The
¬avoid-top-lines≈avoid-top-lines and ¬avoid-bottom-lines≈avoid-bottom-lines variables tell
Epsilon how many screen lines at the top and bottom of the screen are
reserved, and may not contain tiled windows.  By default,
echo_line contains the number of the last screen line,
avoid-top-lines is zero, and avoid-bottom-lines is one,
to make room for the echo area.

To Epsilon display text in the echo area whenever it's idle, set the
variables ¬show-when-idle≈show-when-idle and ¬show-when-idle-column≈show-when-idle-column.
See Rshowwhenidleπshow-when-idle.

To position the echo area at the top of the screen, set
echo-line and avoid-bottom-lines to zero and
avoid-top-lines to one.  (If you're using a permanent mouse
menu, set echo-line and avoid-top-lines one higher.)

To completely fill the screen with text, toggle borders off and set
avoid-bottom-lines and avoid-top-lines to zero.  Whenever
Epsilon needs to display text in the echo area, it will temporarily
overwrite the last screen line for a moment, and then return to
showing buffer text on every line.

You can customize the position and contents of the mode line Epsilon
displays for ordinary tiled windows by setting variables.  These
variables all start with "mode-".  See Rmodeendπmode-end.

You can set several variables to put borders around the screen.  If
you want Epsilon to always display a window border at the right edge
of the screen, set the variable ¬border-right≈border-right nonzero.  (The
toggle-scroll-bar command, which turns on permanent scroll
bars for all windows, sets this variable.)  Epsilon displays a border
at the left screen edge if ¬border-left≈border-left has a nonzero value.
Similarly, ¬border-top≈border-top and ¬border-bottom≈border-bottom variables
control borders at the top and bottom edges of the screen, but only
if a tiled window reaches all the way to that edge of the screen.  (A
menu bar might be in the way.)  All these variables are zero by
default.  (Toggling all window borders off with the
toggle-borders command overrides these variables.)  If the
¬border-inside≈border-inside variable is nonzero (as it is by default),
Epsilon displays a border between side-by-side windows.  Set it to
zero to eliminate these borders.  (The toggle-borders command
sets this variable, among other things.)

3The Bell

bell, settingRbell-on-Sometimes Epsilon will ring the computer's bell
to alert you to certain conditions.  (Well, actually it sounds more
like a beep, but we call it a bell anyway.)  You can enable or
disable the bell completely by setting the ¬want-bell≈want-bell variable.
Epsilon will never try to beep if want-bell has a value of
zero.

For finer control of just when Epsilon rings the
bell, you can set the variables listed in the table using
the set-variable command, described in Rvarsettingπvarsetting.  A nonzero value means Epsilon will ring the
bell when the indicated condition occurs.  By default, all these
variables but bell-on-abort have the value 1, so Epsilon rings
the bell on almost all of these occasions.

Ω– 2 26 VariableWhen Epsilon Beeps, if Nonzero¬bell-on-abort≈bell-on-abortYou abort with Ctrl-G, or press an unbound key.¬bell-on-autosave-error≈bell-on-autosave-errorAutosaving can't write files.¬bell-on-bad-key≈bell-on-bad-keyYou press an illegal option at a prompt.¬bell-on-completion≈bell-on-completionCompletion finds no matches.¬bell-on-date-warning≈bell-on-date-warningEpsilon notices that a file has changed on disk.¬bell-on-read-error≈bell-on-read-errorEpsilon cannot read a file.¬bell-on-search≈bell-on-searchSearch finds no more matches.¬bell-on-write-error≈bell-on-write-errorEpsilon cannot write a file.—æ

¿Variables that control when Epsilon rings the bell¡

RbellvarsRbeepingThe ¬beep-duration≈beep-duration variable specifies the
duration of the beep, in hundredths of a second.  The
¬beep-frequency≈beep-frequency variable specifies the frequency of the bell in
hertz.

A value of zero for beep-duration has special meaning.  Under
DOS, it causes Epsilon to print a Control-G character via the BIOS;
under OS/2 it causes Epsilon to make a warbling sound.  Instead of
making a sound for the bell, you can have Epsilon invert the mode
line of each window for a time according to the value of
beep-duration by setting beep-frequency to zero, and
beep-duration to any nonzero value.

Under Windows, Epsilon doesn't use the beep-duration or
beep-frequency variables.  It uses a standard system sound
instead.  Under Unix, Epsilon recognizes a beep-frequency of
zero and flashes the screen in some fashion, but otherwise ignores
these variables.

2Buffers and Files
3Buffers

buffer, commandsThe Ctrl-X B command prompts you for a buffer
name.  The command creates a buffer if one with that name doesn't
already exist, and connects the buffer to the current window.

The ¬new-file command creates a new buffer and marks it so that
Epsilon will prompt for its file name when you try to save it.  It
doesn't prompt for a buffer name, unlike Ctrl-X B, but chooses an unused
name.  Another difference is that Epsilon will warn about saving
changes to a buffer created by new-file, while a buffer
created by Ctrl-X B is treated as a scratch buffer.

You can customize the behavior of the new-file command by
setting the variables ¬new-file-mode≈new-file-mode and ¬new-file-ext≈new-file-ext.
The ¬new-file-mode≈new-file-mode variable contains the name of the
mode-setting command Epsilon should use to initialize new buffers;
the default is the c-mode command.  The ¬new-file-ext≈new-file-ext
variable contains the extension of the file name Epsilon constructs
for the new buffer; its default is ".c".

To get a list of the buffers, type Ctrl-X Ctrl-B.  This runs the
¬bufed (for buffer edit) command, described fully in Rbufedπbufed.  Basically, bufed lists your buffers, along
with their sizes and the files (if any) contained in those buffers.
You can then easily switch to any buffer by positioning point on the
line describing the buffer and pressing the ⁄Space€ key.  The
bufed command initially positions point on the buffer from
which you invoked bufed.  Press Ctrl-G if you decide not to
switch buffers after all.

The ¬bufed command usually does not list special buffers such
as the kill buffers.  If you prefix a numeric argument, however,
¬bufed shows all the buffers.

The Ctrl-X K command eliminates a buffer.  It asks you for a buffer name
and gets rid of it.  If the buffer has unsaved changes, the command
warns you first.

The Ctrl-X Ctrl-K command eliminates the current buffer, just like Ctrl-X K,
but without asking which buffer you want to get rid of.  The
¬kill-all-buffers command discards all user buffers.

Whenever Epsilon asks you for a buffer name, it can do completion on
buffer names, and will list matches in a pop-up window
if you press "?".

You can also change to another buffer using the ¬next-buffer and
¬previous-buffer commands.  They select the next (or previous)
buffer and connect it to the current window.  You can cycle through
all the buffers by repeating these commands.  You can type F12 and
F11, respectively, to run these commands.  If your keyboard doesn't
have these keys, you can also type Ctrl-X > and Ctrl-X <.

3Files
4Reading Files

dired command, and
find-filefind-file command, and diredRfindfileRfilecmds
The Ctrl-X Ctrl-F key runs the ¬find-file command.  It prompts
you for a file name.  First, it scans the current buffers to see if
any of them contain that file.  If so, the command connects that
buffer to the current window.  Otherwise, the command creates a
buffer with the same name as the file, possibly modified to make it
different from the names of existing non-empty buffers, then reads
the file into that buffer.  Normally Epsilon examines the file's
contents to determine if it's a binary file, or in Unix or Macintosh
format.  If you prefix a numeric argument to ¬find-file,
Epsilon asks you for the correct format, as described in Rtranslatenlπtranslatenl.  Most people consider ¬find-file the
command they typically use to edit a new file, or to return to a file
read in previously.

If you type ⁄Enter€ without typing any file name when
find-file asks for a file, it runs dired on the
current directory.  If you give find-file a file name with
wild card characters, or a directory name, it runs the dired
command giving it that pattern.  See Rdiredπdired for a
description of the very useful dired command.  Also see Rfilepromptsπfileprompts for information on related topics like how to
type a file name with ⁄Space€ characters, customize the way
Epsilon prompts for files, and so forth.

directory name, avoid typingBy default, at most prompts for
file names like find-file's, Epsilon types in for you the
directory portion of the current file.  For example, suppose the
current buffer contains a file named "¥src¥new¥ll.c".  If you invoke ¬find-file , Epsilon will type in
"¥src¥new¥" for you.  This comes in handy when
you want to read another file in the same directory as the current
file.  You can simply begin typing another file name if you want
Epsilon to ignore the pre-typed directory name.  As soon as Epsilon
notices you're typing an absolute file pathname, it will erase the
pre-typed directory name.  See Rfilepromptsπfileprompts for
details.

directory, setting currentYou can change the current
directory with the ¬cd command on F7.  It prompts for a new
current directory, and then displays the full pathname of the
selected current directory.  You can type the name of a new
directory, or just type ⁄Enter€ to stay in the current directory.
When you supply a file name, Epsilon interprets it with respect to
the current directory unless it begins with a slash or backslash.  If
you specify a drive as part of the directory name, Epsilon will set
the current drive to the indicated drive, then switch to the
indicated directory.  Press Alt-E when prompted for a directory name,
and Epsilon will insert the name of the directory containing the
current file.

The ¬insert-file command on Ctrl-X I prompts for the name of a file
and inserts it before point.  It sets the mark before the inserted
text, so you can kill it with Ctrl-W.

The ¬find-linked-file command on Ctrl-X Ctrl-L looks for a file
name in the current buffer, then finds that file.  It works with
plain text files, and also understands #include in C-like
buffers, <a href=> in HTML-like buffers, and
various other mode-specific conventions.

Epsilon uses a built-in list of directories to search for
#include files; you can set the ¬include-directories≈include-directories
variable to add to that list.  For files with a .lst extension, it
assumes the current line holds a file name, instead of searching for
a pattern that matches a typical file name.  This is one way to
more easily manage files in a project that are in many different
directories.

reverting to old fileThe key Ctrl-X Ctrl-V runs the
¬visit-file command.  It prompts you for a file name.  If the
file exists, the command reads it into the current buffer, and
positions point at the beginning.  The command discards the old
contents of the buffer, but asks before discarding an unsaved buffer.
If no file with the given name exists, the command clears the current
buffer.  If you prefix this command with a numeric argument, the
command discards the old buffer content without warning.  So if you
want to revert to the copy of the file on disk, disregarding the
changes you've made since you last saved the buffer, press Ctrl-U
Ctrl-X Ctrl-V, followed by ⁄Enter€.  Most people use this command
only to explicitly manipulate the file associated with a particular
buffer.  To read in a file, use the find-file command,
described above.

The ¬revert-file command rereads the current file from disk.
If you've made any unsaved changes, it prompts first.

4Read-Only Files

read-only files and buffersWhenever you read a read-only file
into a buffer using find-file or visit-file, Epsilon
makes the buffer read-only, and indicates this by displaying "RO"
in the modeline.  Epsilon keeps you from modifying a read-only
buffer.  Attempts to do so result in an error message.  In a
read-only buffer you can use the ⁄Space€ and ⁄Backspace€ keys
to page forward and back more conveniently; see the
¬readonly-pages≈readonly-pages variable to disable this.

If you want to modify the buffer, you can change its read-only status
with the ¬change-read-only command on Ctrl-X Ctrl-Q.  With no
numeric argument, it toggles the read-only status.  With a non-zero
numeric argument, it makes the buffer read-only; with a numeric
argument of zero, it makes the buffer changeable.

The change-read-only command sets the buffer's status but
doesn't change the read-only status of its file.  Use the
¬change-file-read-only command to toggle whether or not
a file is read-only.

By default, when Epsilon reads a read-only file, it displays a
message and makes the buffer read-only.  To make Epsilon do something
else instead, you can set the ¬readonly-warning≈readonly-warning variable,
default 3, according to the table.

¿Values for the readonly-warning variable.¡

RreadonlyvarsSometimes you may want to edit a file that is not read-only, but
still have Epsilon keep you from making any accidental changes to the
file.  The ¬find-read-only-file command does this.  It prompts
for a file name just like find-file and reads it, but marks
the buffer read-only so it cannot be modified, and sets it so that if
you should ever try to save the file, Epsilon will prompt for a
different name.

4Saving Files

file datesThe Ctrl-X Ctrl-S key writes a buffer to the file name associated with the
buffer.  If the current buffer contains no file, the command
asks you for a file name.

To write the buffer to some other file, use the Ctrl-X Ctrl-W key.  The
command prompts for a file name and writes the buffer to that file.
Epsilon then associates that file name with the buffer, so later Ctrl-X
Ctrl-S commands will write to the same file.  If the file you specified
already exists, Epsilon will ask you to confirm that you wish to
overwrite it.  To disable this warning, you can set the variable
¬warn-before-overwrite≈warn-before-overwrite to zero.  (Setting the variable to zero
also prevents several other commands from asking for confirmation
before overwriting a file.)

Before Epsilon saves a file, it checks the copy of
the file on disk to see if anyone has modified it since you read it
into Epsilon.  This might happen if another user edited the file
(perhaps over a network), or if a program running concurrently with
Epsilon modified the file.  Epsilon does this by comparing the file's
date and time to the date and time Epsilon saved when it read the
file in.  If they don't match (within a tolerance determined by the
¬file-date-tolerance≈file-date-tolerance variable), Epsilon displays a warning and
asks you what you want to do.  You can choose to read the disk
version of the file and discard the one already in a buffer, replace
the copy on disk with the copy you've edited, or compare the two
versions.

Epsilon checks the file date of a file each time you switch to a
buffer or window displaying that file, and before you read or write
the file.  When a file changes on disk and you haven't modified the
copy in memory, Epsilon automatically reads the new version.  (It
doesn't do this automatically if the file on disk is substantially
smaller than the copy in memory.)  You can make Epsilon always ask
before reading by setting the buffer-specific variable
¬auto-read-changed-file≈auto-read-changed-file to zero.  Or set the buffer-specific
variable ¬want-warn≈want-warn to 0 if you don't want Epsilon to ever
check the file date or warn you.

Epsilon automatically marks a buffer as "modified" when you change
it, and shows this with a star "*" at the end of the buffer's mode
line.  When Epsilon writes a buffer to disk or reads a file into
a buffer, it marks the buffer as "unmodified".  When you try to exit
Epsilon, it will issue a warning if any buffer contains a file with
unsaved changes.

You may occasionally want to change a buffer's modified status.  You
can do this with the ¬change-modified command.  Each time you
invoke this command, the modified status of the current buffer
toggles, unless you invoke it with a numeric argument.  A nonzero
numeric argument sets the modified status; a numeric argument of zero
clears the modified status.

The ¬save-all-buffers command, bound to Ctrl-X S, goes to each
buffer with unsaved changes (those marked modified), and if it
contains a file, writes the buffer out to that file.

The ¬write-region command on Ctrl-X W takes the text between
point and mark, and writes it to the file whose name you provide.

4Backup Files

template, file
namefile name templatebackup filesRtemplatesEpsilon doesn't normally keep the previous version
of a file around when you save a modified version.  If you want
backups of saved files, you can set the buffer-specific variable
¬want-backups≈want-backups to 1, using the set-variable command
described in Rvarsettingπvarsetting.  If this variable is 1,
the first time you save a file in a session, Epsilon will first
preserve the old version by renaming any existing file with that name
to a file with the extension ".bak".  For instance, saving a new
version of the file text.c preserves the old version in text.bak.
(If you delete a file's buffer and later read the file again, Epsilon
treats this as a new session and makes a new backup copy the next
time you save.)  If want-backups variable is 2, Epsilon
will do this each time you save the file, not just the first time.

You can change the name Epsilon uses for a
backup file by setting the variable ¬backup-name≈backup-name.  Epsilon uses
this as a ªtemplateº for constructing the backup file name.  It
copies the template, substituting pieces of the original file for
codes in the template, according to the table.  The
sequence %r substitutes a relative pathname to the original file
name, if the file is within the current directory or its
subdirectories, or an absolute pathname otherwise.

The sequence %x substitutes the full pathname of the directory
containing the Epsilon executable.  The sequence %X substitutes the
same full pathname, but this time after converting all Windows
95/98/NT long file names making up the path to their equivalent short
name aliases.  For example, if the Epsilon executable was in the
directory c:¥Program Files¥Epsilon¥bin¥, %x would use exactly that pathname, while %X might
yield c:¥Progra~¥Epsilon¥bin¥.
Except under Windows 95/98/NT, %X is the same as %x.  Either always
ends with a path separator character like / or ¥.

¿File name template characters.¡

RtemplatetabIf any other character follows %, Epsilon puts that
character into the backup file name.  You can use this, for
example, to include an actual % character in your backup file name,
by putting %% in the template.

autosaving files
saving files automaticallyEpsilon can automatically save a copy of your file every 500
characters.  To make Epsilon autosave, set the variable
¬want-auto-save≈want-auto-save to 1.  Epsilon then counts keys as you type
them, and every 500 keys, saves each of your modified files to a file with
the extension ".asv".  Epsilon uses a template (see
above) to construct this name as well, stored in the variable
¬auto-save-name≈auto-save-name.  You can alter the number of keystrokes
between autosaves by setting the variable
¬auto-save-count≈auto-save-count.

Sometimes you may want to explicitly write the buffer out to a file
for backup purposes, but may not want to change the name of the file
associated with the buffer.  For that, use the ¬copy-to-file
command on Ctrl-F7.  It asks you for the name of a file, and writes the
buffer out to that file, but subsequent Ctrl-X Ctrl-S's will save to the
original file.

4Line Translation

executable
files, editingbinary files, editingtranslationcarriage return
translationline translationUnix filesMacintosh filesRtranslatenlMost Windows, DOS and OS/2
programs use files with lines separated by the
pair of characters Return, Newline (or Control-M, Control-J).  But
internally Epsilon separates lines with just the newline
character, Ctrl-J.  Epsilon normally
translates between the two systems automatically when reading or
writing text files in this format.  When it reads a file, it removes
all Ctrl-M characters, and when it writes a file, it adds a Ctrl-M
character before each Ctrl-J.

Epsilon will automatically select one of several other translation
types when appropriate, based on the contents of the file you edit.
It automatically determines whether you're editing a regular file, a
binary file, a Unix file, or a Mac file, and uses the proper
translation scheme.  You can explicitly override this if necessary.
Epsilon determines the file type by looking at the first few thousand
bytes of the file, and applying heuristics.  This is quite reliable
in practice.  However, Epsilon may occasionally guess incorrectly.
You can tell Epsilon exactly which translation scheme to use by
providing a numeric argument to a file reading command like
find-file.  Epsilon will then prompt for which translation
scheme to use.

The ¬set-line-translate command sets this behavior for the
current buffer.  It prompts for the desired type of translation, and
makes future file reads and writes use that translation.  Epsilon
will display "Binary", "Unix", "DOS", or "Mac" in the mode
line to indicate any special translation in effect.  (It omits this
when the "usual" translation is in effect: Unix files in Epsilon
for Unix, DOS files in other versions.)

Set the default-translation-type variable if you want to force
Epsilon to always use a particular type of translation when reading
existing files, rather than examining their contents and choosing a
suitable type.  Set the new-buffer-translation-type variable if
you want Epsilon to create new buffers and files with a translation
type other than the default.  For file names that start with ftp://,
the ¬ftp-ascii-transfers≈ftp-ascii-transfers variable can changes the meaning of
some translation types; see its description in Rftpasciitransfersπftp-ascii-transfers.

Epsilon remembers the type of translation you want in each buffer
using the buffer-specific variable ¬translation-type≈translation-type.

Epsilon applies the following heuristics, in order, to determine a
file's type.  These may change in future versions.

A file that contains null bytes is considered binary.  A file that
has no Ctrl-M Ctrl-J pairs is considered a Unix file if it contains
Ctrl-J characters, or a Macintosh file if it contains Ctrl-M.  A file
containing a Ctrl-M character not followed by either Ctrl-M or Ctrl-J
is considered binary.  Any other files, or files of less than five
characters, are considered to be in standard DOS format (in Epsilon
for Unix, Unix format).

Bear in mind that Epsilon makes all these decisions after examining
only the first few thousand bytes of a file, and phrases like
"contains null bytes" really mean "contains null bytes in its
first few thousand characters."

4DOS/OEM Character Set Support

character sets, convertingWindows programs typically use a
different character set than do DOS programs.  The DOS character set
is known as the DOS/OEM character set, and includes various line
drawing characters and miscellaneous characters not in the
Windows/ANSI set.  The Windows/ANSI character set includes many
accented characters not in the DOS/OEM character set.  Epsilon for
Windows uses the Windows/ANSI character set (with most fonts).

The ¬oem-to-ansi command converts the current buffer from the
DOS/OEM character set to the Windows/ANSI character set.  The
¬ansi-to-oem command does the reverse.  If any character in the
buffer doesn't have a unique translation, these commands warn before
translating, and move to the first character without a unique
translation.

The ¬find-oem-file command reads a file using the DOS/OEM
character set, translating it into the Windows/ANSI character set,
and arranges things so when you save the file, the reverse
translation automatically occurs.  These commands are only available
in Epsilon for Windows.

4File Name Prompts

prompts, for file namesfile name promptsYou can
customize many aspects of Epsilon's behavior when prompting for file
names.

By default, many commands in the Windows version of Epsilon use the
standard Windows common file dialog, but only when you invoke them
from a menu or the tool bar.  When you invoke these commands using
their keyboard bindings, they use the same kind of dialog as other
Epsilon prompts.

Set ¬want-common-file-dialog≈want-common-file-dialog to 2 if you want Epsilon to
use the common file dialog whenever it can.  Set
want-common-file-dialog to 0 to prevent Epsilon from ever
using this dialog.  The default value of 1 produces the behavior
described above.

The Windows common file dialog includes a list of common file
extensions.  You can customize this list by editing the Epsilon
source file filter.h.  See the comments in that file for more
information.

All the remaining variables described in this section have no effect
when Epsilon uses the standard Windows dialog; they only modify
Epsilon's own file dialogs.

RfilepromptsThe ¬prompt-with-buffer-directory≈prompt-with-buffer-directory variable
controls how Epsilon uses the current directory at file prompts.
When this variable is 2, the default, Epsilon inserts the current
buffer's directory at many file prompts.  This makes it easy to
select another file in the same directory.  You can edit the
directory name, or you can begin typing a new absolute pathname right
after the inserted pathname.  Epsilon will delete the inserted
pathname when it notices your absolute pathname.  This behavior is
similar to Gnu Emacs's.

When prompt-with-buffer-directory is 1, Epsilon temporarily
changes to the current buffer's directory while prompting for a file
name, and interprets file names relative to the current directory.
This behavior is similar to the "pathname.e" extension available
for previous versions of Epsilon.

When prompt-with-buffer-directory is 0, Epsilon doesn't do
anything special at file prompts.  This was Epsilon's default
behavior in previous versions.

The grep and file-query-replace commands use a
separate variable for their file patterns, with the same meaning as
above.  By default it's 1.

completion, excluding filesDuring file name completion, Epsilon can ignore files with certain
extensions.  The ¬ignore-file-extensions≈ignore-file-extensions variable contains a list of
extensions to ignore.  By default, this variable
has the value "|.obj|.exe|.b|.b2|.bu|", which makes file completion
ignore files that end with .obj, .exe, .b, .b2, and .bu.
Each extension must appear between "|" characters.
You can augment this list using the set-variable command,
described in Rvarsettingπvarsetting.

Similarly, the ¬only-file-extensions≈only-file-extensions variable makes
completion look only for files with certain extensions.  It
uses the same format as ignore-file-extensions, a list of
extensions surrounded by | characters.  If the variable holds a
null pointer, Epsilon uses ignore-file-extensions as above.

When Epsilon prompts for a file name, the ⁄Space€ key performs
file name completion on what you've typed.  To create a new file with
spaces in its name, you must quote the space characters by typing
Ctrl-Q before each one, while entering the name, or type "
characters around the file name (or any part containing spaces).

At any Epsilon prompt (not just file prompts), you can type Alt-E to
retrieve your previous response to that prompt.  Alt-⁄Up€ or
Ctrl-Alt-P show a list of previous responses.  See Rhistoryπhistory for complete details.  And Alt-⁄Down€ or
Ctrl-Alt-N let you easily copy text from the buffer into the prompt
(useful when the buffer contains a file name or URL).  See Rgrabtextπgrabtext for more information.

When Epsilon shows a dialog containing a list of previous responses,
or files matching a pattern, the list may be too wide for the dialog.
You can generally resize the dialog by simply dragging its border.
This works for most Epsilon dialogs.  Epsilon will automatically
remember the size of each dialog from session to session.

4File Name Case

file
names, capitalization ofEPSMIXEDCASEDRIVES, configuration variableMIXEDCASEDRIVES, environment variableRmixedcasedrivesWhen retrieving file
names from some file systems, Epsilon automatically translates the
file names to lower case.  Epsilon uses various different rules for
determining when to convert retrieved file names to lower case, and
when two file names that differ only by case refer to the same file.

Epsilon distinguishes between three types of file systems:

On a case-sensitive file system, MyFile, MYFILE, and myfile refer to
three different files.  Unix file systems are case-sensitive.

On a case-preserving (but not case-sensitive) file system, MyFile,
MYFILE, and myfile all refer to the same file.  But if you create a
file as MyFile, the file system will display that file as MyFile
without altering its case.  VFAT, NTFS, and HPFS file systems used in
Windows 95/98, Windows NT, and OS/2 are case-preserving.

On a non-case-preserving file system, MyFile, MYFILE, and myfile all
refer to the same file.  Moreover, the operating system converts all
file names to upper case.  So no matter how you create the file, the
operating system always shows it as MYFILE.  DOS's FAT file system is
non-case-preserving.  When Epsilon displays a file name from such a
file system, it changes the file name to all lower case.

Epsilon asks the operating system for information on each drive, the
first time the drive is accessed.  (Actually only Epsilon for Windows
95/98/NT and Epsilon for OS/2 can do this; Epsilon for Windows 3.1
assumes that all drives are non-case-preserving.  Epsilon for DOS
asks the operating system when it runs under Windows 95/98; in other
environments it assumes drives are non-case-preserving.  Epsilon for
Unix assumes all file systems are case-sensitive, and the rest of
this section does not apply.)

MIXEDCASEDRIVES, environment variableYou can tell Epsilon to use particular rules for each drive on your
system by defining an environment variable.  The
MIXEDCASEDRIVES environment variable should
contain a list of drive letters or ranges.  If the variable exists
and a lower case letter like k appears in it, Epsilon assumes drive K:
has a Unix-style case-sensitive file system.  If the variable exists
and an upper case letter like J appears in it, Epsilon assumes drive
J: is not case-preserving or case-sensitive, like traditional FAT
drives.  If the variable exists but a drive letter does not appear in
it, Epsilon assumes the drive has a case-preserving but not
case-sensitive file system like NTFS, HPFS, or VFAT drives.

If, for example, drives h:, i:, j:, and p: access Unix filesystems
over a network, drive q: accesses a server that uses a FAT
filesystem, and other drives use a VFAT filesystem (local drives
under NT or 95/98, for example), you could set MIXEDCASEDRIVES to
h-jpQ.  When Epsilon finds a MIXEDCASEDRIVES variable, it assumes
the variable contains a complete list of such drives, and doesn't
examine filesystems as described.  If an EPSMIXEDCASEDRIVES
configuration variable exists, that overrides any MIXEDCASEDRIVES
environment variable that may be found.  (Note that MIXEDCASEDRIVES
appears in the environment under all operating systems, while
EPSMIXEDCASEDRIVES is a configuration variable must be put in
lugeps.ini, in the registry, or in the environment, depending on the
operating system.  See Rconfigvarsπconfigvars for details.)

You can set the variable ¬preserve-filename-case≈preserve-filename-case nonzero to
tell Epsilon to use the case of filenames exactly as retrieved from
the operating system.  By default, Epsilon changes all-uppercase file
names to lower case, except on case-sensitive file systems.

3Internet Support

FTP URLuniform resource locator (URL)URL (uniform resource
locator)InternetRinetEpsilon for Windows 95/98/NT or Unix has several commands
and facilities that make it easy for you to edit files on other
computers using the Internet.

The ¬find-file
and ¬dired commands, as well as a few others, understand
Internet URL's.  If you do a find-file and provide the URL
ftp://user@machine.com/myfile.c, Epsilon will engage in an FTP
interaction to download the file and display it in a buffer.  All of
the Internet activity happens in the background, so you don't have to
wait for the file to download before continuing with your work.  In
fact, the file appears in the buffer as it downloads (syntax
highlighted if appropriate), so you can be editing the beginning of a
large file while the rest of it downloads.

Saving a file in such a buffer, or writing a buffer to
a file name that starts with ftp://, will cause Epsilon to send the
file to the remote computer.  Upload and download status is indicated
in the mode line, and there's also a ¬show-connections command
(on Ctrl-Alt-C) that shows the status of all Internet activities and
buffers.  As in bufed, you can select a buffer and press
⁄Enter€ to switch to it, or press ⁄Escape€ to remain in the
current buffer.

FTP URL's work with dired also, so if you do a dired
(or a find-file) on ftp://user@machine.com, you'll get a
directory listing of the files on the remote machine, in a familiar
dired context.  Dired knows how to delete and rename remote files,
and sort by size, date, file name or extension.  To make Epsilon work
with certain host computers (systems running VMS, for example), you
may need to set the variables ¬ftp-ascii-transfers≈ftp-ascii-transfers or
¬ftp-compatible-dirs≈ftp-compatible-dirs nonzero; see the descriptions of those
variables in Rftpasciitransfersπftp-ascii-transfers.  Other systems may
require you to set the variable ¬ftp-passive-transfers≈ftp-passive-transfers.

Telnet URLThe ¬telnet command lets you connect to a
command shell on a remote computer.  It puts you in a buffer that
works much like the Epsilon process buffer, except the commands you
type are executed on the remote machine.  Provide a numeric prefix
argument and telnet will connect on the specified port instead of the
default port.  You can either use the telnet command
directly, or specify a telnet: URL to find-file.  (Epsilon
ignores any username or password included in the URL.)

Http URLWeb URLWWW URLIf you specify an http:
URL to find-file (for example, http://www.lugaru.com),
Epsilon will use the HTTP protocol to retrieve the HTML code from the
given location.  The HTML code will appear in an appropriately named
buffer, syntax highlighted.  Header information for the URL will
be appended to a buffer named "HTTP Headers".

The Alt-E and Alt-⁄Down€ keys in find-file come in handy
when you want to follow links in an HTML buffer; see Rhistoryπhistory for information on Alt-E and Rgrabtextπgrabtext for information on Alt-⁄Down€.

The ¬finger command prompts for a string like "user@host.com",
then uses the finger protocol to query the given machine for
information about the given user.  The output appears in an
appropriately named buffer.

4URL Syntax

anonymous ftppasswords in URL'sURL syntaxIn Epsilon, URL's must start with ftp://, http://,
or telnet://.  (If you omit the ftp: part, Epsilon for Windows will
pass the file name to Windows as a UNC-style network file name.)

You can specify a user name, password, or
port number using the URL syntax of
service://username:password@hostname:portnumber/filepath.  If you
include a user name but omit the :password part, Epsilon will prompt
for one (and will make sure the password does not appear in your
state file, session file, or similar places).  But if you include a
password in your URL, note that it may be saved in Epsilon's session
file or similar places.

If you omit the username:password@ or username@
part entirely in an ftp URL, Epsilon uses the user name "anonymous"
and the password specified by the ¬anon-ftp-password≈anon-ftp-password variable
(default: EpsilonUser@unknown.host).  You can set this to your email
address if you prefer.

You can also use Emacs-style syntax for specifying remote file names:
/username@hostname:filepath.  Epsilon will behave as if you had typed
the corresponding URL.

In ftp:// URL's, Epsilon treats a file name following the / as a
relative pathname.  That is, ftp://user@host.com/myfile refers to a
file named myfile in the user's home directory.  Put two slashes, as
in ftp://user@host.com//myfile, to refer to /myfile in the root
directory.  You can type ¥ instead of / in any URL and Epsilon
will substitute /.

Rdired-urlIf you type the name of a local directory to the
find-file command, find-file will run the dired
command on it.  With ftp:// URL's, find-file won't always
know that what you typed is a remote directory name (as opposed to a
file name) and might try to retrieve the URL as a file, leading to an
error message like "Not a plain file".  End your URL with a /
to indicate a directory name.

3Printing

margins, setting printerprintingThe
¬print-buffer command on Alt-F9 prints the current buffer.  If a
region is highlighted on the screen, the command prints just that
region.  The ¬print-region command on Shift-F9 always prints
just the current region, whether or not it's highlighted.

Under Windows, the printing commands display the familiar Windows
print dialog.  From this dialog, you can select a different printer,
select particular pages to print, and so forth.  The
¬print-setup command lets you select a different printer without
printing anything, or set the margins.    Invoke the printing
commands with a numeric prefix argument to skip the print dialog and
just print with default settings.  The ¬print-buffer-no-prompt
command also skips the print dialog and uses default settings.

You can change the font Epsilon uses for printing with the
¬set-printer-font command.  See Rfontsπfonts for more
information.

By default, Epsilon for Windows will print in color on color
printers, and in black & white on non-color printers.  You can set
the ¬print-in-color≈print-in-color variable to 0, if you don't want
Epsilon to ever print in color, or to 2 if you want Epsilon to
attempt to use colors even if the printer doesn't appear to be a
color printer.  (Some printers will substitute shades of grey.)  The
default value, 1, produces color printing only on color printers.

If you have a color printer, and want to use a different color scheme
when printing than you do for screen display, set the variable
¬print-color-scheme≈print-color-scheme to the name of the color scheme Epsilon
should use for printing.

Epsilon for Windows prints a heading at the top of each page.  You
can set the ¬print-heading≈print-heading variable to control what it
includes.  The value 1 makes Epsilon include the file name, 2
makes Epsilon include a page number, and 4 makes Epsilon include
the current date.  You can add these values together; the default
value of 7 includes all the above items.  You can set the
variable ¬print-line-numbers≈print-line-numbers nonzero if you want Epsilon to
include line numbers.

Under DOS or OS/2, the printing commands prompt for the device name
of the printer, such as LPT1 or COM2.  They then write the text to
that device name.  If you want Epsilon to run a program that will
print the file, you can do that too.  See the description of the
¬print-destination≈print-destination variable in Rprintdestinationπprint-destination.  (For Unix, see
¬print-destination-unix≈print-destination-unix, which by default runs the lpr
program to print a file.)  If you want Epsilon for Windows to run a
program in order to print a file, bypassing the Windows print dialog,
you can set ¬want-gui-printing≈want-gui-printing to zero.

By default, Epsilon converts tabs to spaces in a copy of the buffer
before printing it.  Set the variable ¬print-tabs≈print-tabs to one if you
want Epsilon to print the file just as it is, including the tab
characters.

3Extended file patterns

file name patternsextended
file patternswildcard file patternsRwildcardsThis section describes Epsilon's
extensions to the rules for wildcard characters in file names.  You
can specify more complicated file name patterns in Epsilon than
Windows, Unix, DOS, or OS/2 normally allow, using the wildcard
characters of square brackets [], commas, semicolons, and curly
braces µ∂.  Epsilon also lets you use the * and ?
characters in more places.  These patterns work in the grep
command, the dired command, and in all other places where
file name wildcards make sense.  (They don't work with Internet
URL's, though.)

First, you can put text after the standard wildcard character *
and Epsilon will match it.  In standard DOS-style patterns, the system
ignores any text in a pattern between a * and the end of the pattern
(or the dot before an extension).  But in Epsilon, ab*ut matches
all files that start with ab and end with ut.  The * matches the
dot character in file names, so the above pattern matches file names
like about as well as absolute.out.  (Use ab*ut. to match only
files like the former, or ab*.*ut to match ones like the latter.)

Instead of ? to match any single character (except dot, slash, or
backslash), you can provide a list of characters in square brackets
(similar to the regular expression patterns of searching).  For
example, file[0123456789stuvw] matches file4, file7, and
files, but not filer.  Inside the square brackets, two
characters separated by a dash represent a range, so you could write
the above pattern as file[0-9s-w].  A caret character ^
just after the [ permits any character but the listed ones, so
fil[^tm]er matches all the files that fil?er matches,
except filter and filmer.  (To include a dash or ] in the
pattern, put it right after the [ or ^.  The pattern
[^-]] matches all characters but - and ].)

You can use ? and * (and the new square bracket syntax)
in directory names.  For example, ¥v*¥*.bat might
match all .bat files in ¥virtmem and in ¥vision.  Because a star character never matches backslash
characters, it would not match ¥vision¥subdir¥test.bat.

The special directory name ** matches any number of directory
names.  You can use it to search entire directory trees.  For
example, ¥**¥*.txt matches all .txt files on
the current drive.  The pattern **¥include¥*.h
matches all .h files inside an include directory, looking in
the current directory, its subdirectories, and all directories within
those.

The simplest new file pattern character is the comma.  You can
run grep on the file pattern foo,bar,baz and Epsilon will search
in each of the three files.  You can use a semicolon in place of a
comma, if you want.

A segment of a file pattern enclosed in curly braces may contain a
sequence of comma-separated parts.  Epsilon will substitute each of
the parts for the whole curly-brace sequence.  For example,
¥cc¥include¥c*t.µbat,txt∂ matches the same
files as ¥cc¥include¥c*t.bat,¥cc¥include¥c*t.txt.  A curly-brace sequence may not
contain another curly-brace sequence, but may contain other wildcard
characters.  For example, the pattern µ,c*¥∂*.µtxt,bat∂ matches .txt and .bat files in the current
directory, or in any subdirectory starting with "c".  The brace
syntax is simply a shorthand for the comma-separated list described
above, so that an equivalent way to write the previous example is
*.txt,c*¥*.txt,*.bat,c*¥*.bat.  Epsilon breaks a
complete pattern into comma-separated sections, then replaces each
section containing curly braces with all the possible patterns
constructed from it.  You can use semicolons between the parts in
braces instead of commas if you prefer.

To match file names containing one of the new wildcard characters,
enclose the character in square brackets.  For example, the pattern
abc[∂] matches the file name abc∂.  (Note that legal DOS
file names may not contain any of the characters [],;, but they
may contain curly braces µ∂.  Other file systems, including
Windows 95/98's VFAT, Windows NT's NTFS, most Unix file systems, and
OS/2's HPFS, allow file names that contain any of these characters.)

Use curly braces to search on multiple drives.  µc,d,e∂:¥**¥*.txt matches all .txt files on drives C:, D:, or E:.
Epsilon does not recognize the *, ?, or [] characters in
the drive name.

3Directory Editing

disk managementRdiredEpsilon has a special mode used
for examining and changing the contents of a directory conveniently.
The ¬dired command, bound to Ctrl-X D, asks for the name of a
directory and puts a listing of the directory, similar to what the
DOS or OS/2 "dir" command produces (or, for Unix, "ls -lF"), in a
special dired buffer.  By default, ¬dired uses the current
directory.  You can supply a file pattern, such as "*.c", and only
matching files will appear.  The ¬dired command puts the
information in a buffer whose name matches the directory and file
pattern, then displays the buffer in the current window.  You can
have multiple dired buffers, each displaying the result of a
different file pattern.

You can also invoke dired from the find-file command.
If you press ⁄Enter€ without typing any file name when
find-file asks for a file, it does a dired on the
current directory.  If you give find-file a file name with
wild card characters, it runs the dired command giving it
that pattern.  If you give find-file a directory name, it
does a dired of that directory.  (When using ftp:// URL's that
refer to a directory, end them with /.  See Rdiredurlπdired-url
for details.)

You can use extended file patterns to list files from multiple
directories.  (See Rwildcardsπwildcards.)  If you use a file
pattern that matches files in more than one directory, Epsilon will
divide the resulting dired buffer into sections.  Each section will
list the files from a single directory.  Epsilon sorts each section
separately.

While in a dired buffer, alphabetic keys run special dired commands.
All other keys still invoke the usual Epsilon commands.

You run most dired commands by pressing plain letters.  The N and
P commands go to the next and previous files, respectively.

The E, ⁄Space€, and ⁄Enter€ keys let you examine the contents
of a file.  They invoke the ¬find-file command on the file,
making the current window display this file instead of the dired
buffer.  To conveniently return to the dired buffer, use the
¬select-buffer command (Ctrl-X B).  Press ⁄Enter€ when
prompted for the buffer name and the previous buffer shown in the
current window (in this case, the dired buffer) will reappear.

When applied to a subdirectory, the E key invokes another
dired on that directory, using the name of the directory for
that dired buffer.  If you have marked files for deletion, and you
run a dired on the same directory, the markings go away.

The "." or "^" keys invoke a dired on the parent
directory of the directory associated with the current dired buffer.

To set Epsilon's current directory to the directory being displayed,
press G (for Go).  If the current line names a directory, Epsilon
will make that be the current directory.  If the current line names a
file, Epsilon will set the current directory to the one containing
that file.

deleting filesrenaming filescopying
filesPress D to flag a file that you wish to delete.  Epsilon will
mark the file for deletion by placing a "D" before its name.  (You
may delete empty directories in the same way.)  Press C or M
to select files for copying or moving (renaming), respectively.
Epsilon will mark the files by placing C or M before their
names.  The U command unmarks the file on the current line,
removing any marks before its name.

The X command actually deletes, copies, or moves the marked
files.  Epsilon will list all the files marked for deletion and ask
you to confirm that you want them deleted.  If any files are marked
for copying or moving, Epsilon will ask for the destination directory
into which the files are to be copied or moved.  If there is only one
file to copy or move, you can also specify a file name destination,
so you can use the command for renaming files.  Epsilon prompts for a
single destination for all files to be copied, and another for all
files to be moved.

There are a few specialized commands for renaming files.  Press
Shift-L to mark a file for lowercasing its name, or Shift-U for
uppercasing.  When you execute with X, each marked file will be
renamed by changing each uppercase character in its name to lowercase
(or vice versa).  (Note that Epsilon for Windows displays
all-uppercase file names in lowercase by default, so Shift-U's effect
may not be visible within Epsilon.  See preserve-filename-case.)

Shift-R marks a file for a regular-expression replacement on its name.  When
you press X to execute operations on marked files, Epsilon will ask for a
pattern and replacement text.  Then, for each file marked with Shift-R,
Epsilon will take the file name and perform the indicated regular expression
replacement on it, generating a new name.  Then Epsilon will rename the file
to the new name.  For instance, to rename a group of files like dir¥file1.cxx, dir¥file2.cxx, etc. to dir2¥file1.cpp, dir2¥file2.cpp, use Shift-R and specify dir¥(.*).cxx as the search text
and dir2¥#1.cpp as the replacement text.  To rename some .htm
files to .html, specify .* as the search text and #0l as the
replacement text.

The ! dired subcommand prompts for a command line, then runs the
specified program, adding the name of the current line's file after
it.

The + command creates a new subdirectory.  It asks for the name
of the subdirectory to create.

The R command refreshes the current listing.  Epsilon will use
the original file pattern to rebuild the file listing.  If you've
marked files for copying, moving, or deleting, the markings will be
discarded if you refresh, so Epsilon will prompt first to confirm
that you want to do this.

The S key controls sorting.  It prompts you to enter another
letter to change the sorting method.  Press N, E, S, or
D to select sorting by file name, file extension, size, or time
and date of modification, respectively.  Press U to turn off
sorting the next time Epsilon makes a dired listing, and display the
file names in the same order they come from the operating system.
(You can have Epsilon rebuild the current listing using the R
subcommand.)

Press + or - at the sorting prompt to sort in ascending or
descending order, respectively, or R to reverse the current
sorting order.

Press G at the sorting prompt to toggle directory grouping.  With
directory grouping, Epsilon puts all subdirectories first in the
list, then all files, and sorts each part individually.  Without
directory grouping, it mixes the two together (although it still puts
. and .. first).

In Epsilon for Windows, press V to run the "viewer" for that
file; the program assigned to it according to Windows file
association.  For executable files, this will run the program.  For
document files, it typically runs the Windows program assigned to
that file extension.  See RDDEπDDE for information on
associating Epsilon with particular file extensions.  Press T to
display the properties of a file or directory.  (This is a convenient
way to see the total size of all files in a directory.)

Several keys provide shortcuts for common operations.  The 1 key
examines the selected file in a window that occupies the whole screen
(like typing Ctrl-X 1 E).  The 2 key splits the current window
horizontally and examines the selected file in the second window,
leaving the dired buffer in the first (like typing Ctrl-X 2 E).
The 5 key functions like the 2 key, but splits the window vertically
(like typing Ctrl-X 5 E).  The O key examines the selected file in
the next window on the screen, without splitting windows any further.
The Z key zooms the window to full-screen, then examines the selected
file (like typing Ctrl-X Z E).

Finally, typing H or ? while in dired invokes help on the
dired command.

The quick-dired-command command on Alt-o is like running a
dired on the current file, then executing a single dired command and
discarding the dired buffer.  It provides a convenient way of
performing various simple file operations without running dired.  It
prompts for another key, one of C, D, M, G, !, T, or V.  Then it
(respectively) copies, deletes, or renames the current file, changes
Epsilon's current directory to the one containing that file, runs a
command on the file, shows the file's properties, or views it using
associations.  Alt-o . displays a dired of the current file.  Alt-o F
views its folder in MS-Windows Explorer.  (The T, V and F options are
only available in Epsilon for Windows.)

The ¬locate-file command prompts for a file name and then
searches for that file, using dired to display the matches.  In
Windows, DOS, and OS/2, it searches for the file on all local hard
drives, skipping over removable drives, CD-ROM drives, and network
drives.  On Unix, it searches through particular parts of the
directory hierarchy specified by the ¬locate-path-unix≈locate-path-unix variable.

The ¬list-files command also takes a file pattern and displays a
list of files.  Unlike dired, its file list uses absolute
pathnames, and it omits the file's size, date, and other information.
It provides just the file names, one to a line.  The command also
doesn't list directory names, as dired does.  The command is
often useful when preparing response files for other programs.

3Buffer List Editing

RbufedThe ¬bufed command on Ctrl-X Ctrl-B functions like
dired, but it works with buffers instead of files.  It
creates a list of buffer names.  Each buffer name appears on a line
along with the size of the buffer, the associated file name (if any)
and a star if the buffer contains unsaved changes, and/or an R if the
buffer is currently marked read-only.  The bufed command pops
up the list, and highlights the line describing the current buffer.

In this buffer, alphabetic keys run special bufed commands.
Alphabetic keys not mentioned do nothing, and non-alphabetic keys run
the usual commands.  The N and P keys go to the next and previous
buffers in the list, respectively, by going down or up one line.  The
D command deletes the buffer on the current line, but warns you if
the buffer contains unsaved changes.  The S key saves the buffer on
the current line, and Shift-P prints the buffer like the
print-buffer command.  The E or ⁄Space€ command selects
the buffer on the current line and displays it in the current window,
removing the bufed listing.

As in dired, several keys provide shortcuts for common
operations.  The 1 key expands the current window to take up the
whole screen, then selects the highlighted buffer.  The 2 key splits
the current window horizontally and selects the highlighted buffer in
the second window.  The 5 key works like the 2 key, except it splits
the window vertically.  The Z key zooms the current window to
full-screen, then selects the highlighted buffer.

By default, the most recently accessed buffers appear at the top of
the list, and those you haven't used recently appear at the end.  The
current buffer always appears at the top of the list.  You can press
"b", "f", or "i" to make Epsilon sort the list by buffer name, file
name, or size, respectively.  Pressing 'a' makes Epsilon sort by
access time again.  Pressing the upper case letters "B", "F", "I", or
"A" reverses the sense of the sort.  Pressing "u" produces a buffer
list ordered by time of creation, with the oldest buffers at the
bottom.

The bufed command does not normally list special buffers such
as the kill buffers.  To include even these buffers, give the
bufed command a numeric argument.  The bufed command
will display buffers that start with a dash character ("-")
only if you prefix the command with a numeric argument.  By default,
bufed pops up a 50-column window in the non-Windows versions.
You can change this width by setting the ¬bufed-width≈bufed-width variable.
(In Epsilon for Windows, change the dialog's width by dragging its
border, as usual.)

2Starting and Stopping Epsilon

You generally exit the editor with Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z, which runs the
command ¬exit-level.  If in a recursive editing level,
exit-level will not exit, but bring you back to the level
that invoked the recursive edit.  If you haven't saved all your
files, Epsilon will display a list using ¬bufed and ask if
you really want to exit.

You may also use ¬exit, Ctrl-X Ctrl-C, to exit the editor.  It
ignores any recursive editing levels.  When given a numeric argument,
Epsilon won't warn you about unsaved files, or write a session file
(see the next section).  It will simply exit immediately.

You can customize Epsilon's actions at startup by defining a hook
function using EEL.  See Rstartuphookπstartuphook.

In Epsilon for Unix, an alternative to exiting Epsilon is to suspend
it using the Alt-x ¬suspend-epsilon command.  This returns
control to the shell that launched Epsilon.  Use the shell's fg
command to resume Epsilon.  When Epsilon runs as an X program, this
command instead minimizes Epsilon's window.

3Session Files

sessions, restoringRsessionWhen you start up Epsilon,
it will try to restore the window and buffer configuration you had
the last time you ran Epsilon.  It will also restore items such as
previous search strings, your positions within buffers, and the
window configuration.

If you set the variable ¬session-always-restore≈session-always-restore to zero,
Epsilon will only try to restore your previous session if you invoke
it without giving a file name on the command line.  If you provide an
explicit file to edit on the command line, Epsilon will read just
that file in, and will refrain from restoring the previous session.
(Also see Rstartupπstartup.)

Epsilon restores your previous session by consulting a session file
named epsilon.ses, which is normally stored in the directory with
Epsilon's other configuration files (or, under Unix, in the directory
~/.epsilon).  By default, Epsilon will write such a file when you
exit.  If you set the value of the variable ¬preserve-session≈preserve-session
to zero, then Epsilon will not write a session file before exiting.
See the description of this variable for more details.  Also see the
-p flag described in Rpflagπpflag.

You can tell Epsilon to search for an existing session file, starting
from the current directory.  If a session file doesn't exist in the
current directory, then Epsilon looks in its parent directory, then
in that directory's parent, and so forth, until it reaches the root
directory or finds a session file.

To let Epsilon search like this, set the ¬session-tree-root≈session-tree-root
variable to empty.  If this variable is set to a directory name in
absolute form, Epsilon will only search for an existing session file
in the named directory or one of its children.  For example, if
¬session-tree-root≈session-tree-root holds c:¥joe¥proj, and the
current directory is c:¥joe¥proj¥src, Epsilon
will search in c:¥joe¥proj¥src, then c:¥joe¥proj, for a session file.  If the current directory is
c:¥joe¥misc, on the other hand, Epsilon won't search at
all (since ¥joe¥misc isn't a child of ¥joe¥proj), but will use the rules below.  By default this
variable is set to the word NONE, an impossible absolute
directory name, so searching is disabled.

If Epsilon finds no such file by searching as described above (or if
such searching is disabled, as it usually is), then Epsilon looks for
a session file in each of these places, in this order:

 If the ¬session-default-directory≈session-default-directory variable is non-empty,
in the directory it names.  (This variable is empty by default.)

 EPSPATH, configuration variableIf the configuration variable EPSPATH can
be found, in the first directory it names. (See Rconfigvarsπconfigvars for more on configuration variables.)

 In the root directory of the current drive (or, for Unix, the
~/.epsilon directory).



All of the above implies that, if you install Epsilon normally and
don't change any settings, Epsilon puts session files in the current
user's home directory under Unix, and in the directory containing its
other files in other environments.

There are three ways to tell Epsilon to search for a file with a
different name, instead of the default of epsilon.ses.  With any of
these methods, specifying an absolute path keeps Epsilon from
searching and forces it to use a particular file.  Epsilon checks for
alternate names in this order:

  F-p, command line flagThe -p flag can specify a different session file name.

 ESESSION, configuration variableAn ESESSION configuration variable can
specify a different session file name.

 The ¬session-file-name≈session-file-name variable can specify a name.



If you wish, you may maintain different sessions associated with
different directories.  To make Epsilon look for its session file
only in the current directory, and create a new session file there on
exiting, set session-default-directory to "." and leave
session-tree-root set to "NONE".  This will force Epsilon
to restrict its attention to the current directory when looking for a
session file.

The ¬write-session command writes a session file, detailing the
files you're currently editing, the window configuration, default
search strings, and so forth.  By default, Epsilon writes a session
file automatically whenever you exit, but you can use this command if
you prefer to save and restore sessions manually.  The
¬read-session command loads a session file, first asking if you
want to save any unsaved files.  Reading in a session file rereads
any files mentioned in the session file, as well as replacing search
strings, all bookmarks, and the window configuration.  However, any
files not mentioned in the session file will remain, as will keyboard
macros, key bindings, and most variable settings.  If you use either
command and specify a different session file than the default,
Epsilon will use the file name you provided when it automatically
writes a session file as you exit.

You can set the ¬session-restore-files≈session-restore-files variable to control
whether Epsilon restores files named in a session file, or just
search strings, command history, and similar settings.  If
session-restore-files is 0, when Epsilon restores a
session, it won't load any files named in the session, only things
like previous search strings.  If 1, the default, Epsilon will
restore previous files as well as other settings.  If 2, Epsilon
will restore previous files only if there were no files specified on
Epsilon's command line.

You can set the ¬session-restore-max-files≈session-restore-max-files variable to limit
the number of files Epsilon will reread, which is by default 30.  The
files are prioritized based on the time of their last viewing in
Epsilon, so by default Epsilon restores the 30 files you've most
recently edited.

You can set the ¬session-restore-directory≈session-restore-directory variable to control
whether Epsilon restores any current directory setting in the session
file.  Set it to 0 and Epsilon will never do this.  Set it to
1 and Epsilon will always restore the current directory when it
reads a session file.  The default value 2 makes Epsilon restore
the current directory setting only when the -w1 flag has been
specified.  (Under Windows, Epsilon's installer includes this flag
when it makes Start Menu shortcuts.)

3File Associations and DDE

associations, filefile
associationsDDERDDEYou can set up file associations
in Epsilon for Windows using the ¬create-file-associations
command.  It lets you modify a list of common extensions, then sets
up Windows to invoke Epsilon to edit files with those extensions.
The files will be sent to an existing copy of Epsilon, if one is
running, via a Windows DDE execute message.

Dynamic Data Exchange, or DDE, is one mechanism in Windows for
programs to talk to each other.  A DDE server is a program that knows
how to "listen" for messages from other programs.  A DDE client is
a program that knows how to send a message using DDE.

When you double-click on a shell icon, and you want a program to
start editing a file, Windows arranges for this in one of two ways.
The simple way: Windows just starts a new copy of the program and
tells it to edit that file.  The disadvantage is that you get
multiple copies of the program running, if you click on multiple
files.

The better way uses DDE.  The create-file-associations
command sets things up so that Windows will know how to use DDE to
talk to a copy of Epsilon.  So now when you double-click on a file
registered to Epsilon, Windows will first try to send a message to
Epsilon saying "please edit this file".  If there's no running copy
of Epsilon, Windows will notice that no program accepted the message,
and it will know it needs to run the program itself.

 F-add, command line flag F-nodde, command line flag F-dde, command line flagEpsilon's command line flag -add tells Epsilon for Windows to
locate an existing instance of Epsilon, pass it the rest of the
command line via DDE, and exit.  (Epsilon ignores the flag if there's
no prior instance.)  The command line flag -nodde tells Epsilon
for Windows that it should not respond to DDE messages from other
programs; Epsilon will not register itself as a DDE server.  The
command line flag -dde may be used to alter the DDE server name
for an instance of Epsilon.  An instance of Epsilon started with
-dde:»somename… -add will only pass its command line to a
previous instance started with the same -dde:»somename… flag.

 PWIN_DRAG_DROP, textual macroA DDE execute message to Epsilon uses a subset of the syntax of
Epsilon's command line.  It can contain file names to edit, the
+»linenum… flag, the flag -d»varname…=»value… to
set an Epsilon variable, -l»filename… to load an EEL bytecode
file, or -r»funcname… to run an EEL function, command, or
macro.  Epsilon uses a DDE server name of "Epsilon" and a topic
name of "Open".  (The flag -dde:»name… makes Epsilon use a
server name of »name… instead, as above.)  Spaces separate file
names and flags in the DDE message; surround a file name or flag with
" characters if it contains spaces.  In EEL, DDE messages arrive
via a special kind of πMWIN_DRAG_DROP event.

3MS-Windows Integration Features

Microsoft Developer
Studio, integrating withintegrate with Visual StudioVisual Studio, integration
withintegrating with
Developer StudioDeveloper Studio, integrating withEpsilon can integrate with Microsoft's Developer Studio (Visual
Studio) in several ways.  One lets you press a key (or click a
button) while editing a file in Developer Studio, and start Epsilon
on the same file.  The other automates this process, so any attempt
to open a source file in Developer Studio is routed to Epsilon.

For on-demand integration, you can add Epsilon
to the Tools menu in Microsoft Developer Studio.  You'll then be able
to select Epsilon from the menu and have it begin editing the same
file you're viewing in Developer Studio, at the same line.  To do
this, use the Tools/Customize menu command in Developer Studio.
Select the Tools tab in the Customize dialog that appears.  Create a
new entry for the Tools menu, and set the Command field to the name
of Epsilon's executable, epsilon.exe.  Set the Arguments field to -add
+$(CurLine) $(FilePath).  You may set the Initial Directory field
to $(FileDir) if you wish.

You can also set up Developer Studio 5.0 or later to do the above
automatically, so that every time Developer Studio tries to open a
source file, Epsilon appears and opens the file instead.
To set up Developer Studio 5.0 or later so its attempts to open a
source file are passed to Epsilon, use the Customize command on the
Tools menu and select the Add-ins and Macro Files page in the dialog.
Click Browse, select Add-ins (.dll) as the File Type, and navigate to
the VISEPSIL.DLL file located in the directory containing Epsilon's
executable (typically c:¥Program Files¥Epsilon¥bin).  Select that file.

Close the Customize dialog and a window containing an Epsilon icon (a
blue letter E) should appear.  You can move the icon to any toolbar
by dragging it.  Click the icon and a dialog will appear with two
options.  Unchecking the first will disable this add-in entirely.  If
you uncheck the second, then any time you try to open a text file in
Dev Studio it will open in both Epsilon and Dev Studio.  When
checked, it will only open in Epsilon.

4Running Epsilon via a Shortcut

shortcut,
running Epsilon from adesktop icon, running Epsilon from aSend To menu, putting Epsilon on
asendeps programEpsilon comes with a program, sendeps.exe, that's
installed in the directory containing Epsilon's main executable.  It
provides some flexibility when you create a desktop icon for Epsilon,
or use the Send To feature (both of which involve creating a Windows
shortcut).

If you create a desktop shortcut for Epsilon, or use the Send To
feature in Windows, have it refer to this sendeps.exe program instead
of Epsilon's main executable.  Sendeps will start Epsilon if
necessary, or locate an existing copy of Epsilon, and load the single
file named on its command line.

This is useful because Windows ignores a shortcut's flags (command
line settings) when you drop a document on a shortcut, or when you
use the Send To feature.  (If it used the flags, you could simply
create a shortcut to Epsilon's main executable and pass its -add
flag.  Since it doesn't, sending a file requires a separate program.)
Also, Windows sends long file names without quoting them in these
cases, which would cause problems if sent directly to Epsilon.

Sendeps may be configured through entries in a lugeps.ini file
located in your Windows directory.  The section name it uses is the
same as the base name of its executable (so making copies of the
executable under different names lets you have multiple Send To
entries that behave differently, for instance).

These are its default settings:

Ω[SendEps]≤server=Epsilon≤topic=Open≤ddeflags=≤executable=epsilon.exe≤runflags=-add -w1≤æ≤
Here's how Sendeps uses the above settings.  It first looks for a DDE
server named server.  If found, it sends the server a command
line consisting of the ddeflags setting, followed by the file
name passed on its command line (inside double quotes), using the
specified DDE topic name.  If there's no such DDE server running,
Sendeps executes a command line built by concatenating the
executable name, the runflags, and the quoted file name.

2Running Other Programs

running other programsshelling
commandsprograms, runningRpushEpsilon provides several
methods for running other programs from within Epsilon.  The
¬push command on Ctrl-X Ctrl-E starts a command processor
(shell) running.  You can then issue shell commands.  When you type
the "exit" command, you will return to Epsilon and can resume your
work right where you left off.

With a numeric argument, the command asks for a command line to pass
to the shell, runs this command, then returns.  Epsilon asks you to
type a key when the command finishes, so that you have a chance to
read the command's output before Epsilon reclaims the screen.

While Epsilon runs a command processor or other program with the
push command, it looks like you ran the program from outside
of Epsilon.  But Epsilon can make a copy of the input and output that
occurs during the program's execution, and show it to you when the
program returns to Epsilon.  If you set the variable ¬capture-output≈capture-output
to a nonzero value (normally it has the value zero), Epsilon
will make such a transcript.  When you return to Epsilon,
this transcript will appear in a buffer named "process".  In this
case, Epsilon won't ask you to type a key when the process finishes,
since the entire session appears in the process buffer.

You can use the ¬filter-region command on Alt-| to process
the current region through an external command.  Epsilon will run the
command, sending a copy of the region to it as its standard input.
By default, the external command's output goes to a new buffer.  Run
filter-region with a numeric argument if you want the output
to replace the current region.

Rshrinking
shrinking, while running other programsUnder DOS, the ¬shell-shrinks≈shell-shrinks variable helps to determine the
amount of memory available to the process.  If zero, Epsilon and the
process split the available memory (see Rmiszeroπmiszero for
details).  Thus, very large programs may run out of memory when run
from within Epsilon in this way.  If shell-shrinks has a
nonzero value, Epsilon will unload itself from memory until you exit
from the process, leaving only a small section of itself behind.  We
call this ªshrinkingº.  After your program runs, Epsilon will
reload itself, leaving you in exactly the same state as before the
shrinking occurred.  By default, shell-shrinks has a nonzero
value.

shrinking, file usedEpsilon for DOS shrinks by copying most of itself to a file named
ªeshrinkº, normally in the same directory it creates a swap file
in.  See Rswapfileπswapfile.  However, if Epsilon has access to
EMS or XMS memory for buffers, it will put as much of itself as will
fit there before it creates an eshrink file.

RepsshellEPSCOMSPEC, configuration variableCOMSPEC, environment variableEPSSHELL, configuration variableSHELL, environment variableConfiguration
variables (see Rconfigvarsπconfigvars) let you customize what command Epsilon runs
when it wants to start a process.  Epsilon runs the command file
named by the EPSCOMSPEC configuration variable.  If no such variable
exists, Epsilon uses the standard COMSPEC environment variable
instead.  Epsilon reports an error if neither exists.

INTERSHELLFLAGS, configuration variableCMDSHELLFLAGS, configuration variableIf a configuration
variable named INTERSHELLFLAGS has been defined, Epsilon passes the
contents of this variable to the program as its command line.  When
Epsilon needs to pass a command line to the program, it doesn't use
INTERSHELLFLAGS.  Instead, it inserts the contents of the
CMDSHELLFLAGS variable before the command line you type.

If Epsilon can't find a definition for INTERSHELLFLAGS or
CMDSHELLFLAGS, it substitutes flags appropriate for the operating
system.

3The Concurrent Process

multitaskingconcurrent
processRstartprocessRprocessesEpsilon can also run a program in a special way that allows you to
interact with the program in a buffer and continue editing while the
program runs.  It can help in preparing command lines, by letting you
edit things you previously typed, and it automatically saves what
each program types, so you can examine it later.  If a program takes
a long time to produce a result, you can continue to edit files while
it works.  We call a program run in this way a ªconcurrent
processº.

The ¬start-process command, bound to Ctrl-X Ctrl-M, begins a
concurrent process.  Without a numeric argument,
it starts a shell command processor which will run until you exit it
(by going to the end of the buffer and typing "exit").  With a
numeric argument, it prompts you for the name of a program, instructs
the shell to execute just that one command, then terminates the
concurrent process.

Epsilon maintains a command history for the concurrent process
buffer.  You can use Alt-P and Alt-N to retrieve the text of previous
commands.  You can also use file name completion in the concurrent
process buffer to type file names more easily.  Type part of a file
name and press ⁄Tab€, and Epsilon will complete it.  If the name
is ambiguous, Epsilon displays a list of matches.

INTERCONCURSHELLFLAGS, configuration variableCMDCONCURSHELLFLAGS, configuration variableEPSCONCURCOMSPEC, configuration variableEPSCONCURSHELL, configuration variableEPSCOMSPEC, configuration variableEPSSHELL, configuration variableAs described in the previous section, you can change the name of the
shell command processor Epsilon calls, and specify what command line
switches Epsilon should pass to it, by setting configuration
variables.  Some different configuration variable names override
those variables, but only when Epsilon starts a subprocess
concurrently.  For example, you might run a command processor that
you have to start with a special flag when Epsilon runs it
concurrently.
The
INTERCONCURSHELLFLAGS and CMDCONCURSHELLFLAGS variables override
INTERSHELLFLAGS and CMDSHELLFLAGS, respectively.
The
EPSCONCURCOMSPEC variable
overrides EPSCOMSPEC.

4DOS command processorFor example, the 4DOS command processor
replacement for DOS needs a special flag //Lineinput=yes whenever you
run it concurrently.  Set these configuration variables (see Rconfigvarsπconfigvars) to use Epsilon with 4DOS:

ΩHamilton C Shellshell,
replacements forcommand processor, replacements forset EPSCOMSPEC=c:¥4dos¥4dos.exe≤set CMDCONCURSHELLFLAGS=//Lineinput=yes /c≤set INTERCONCURSHELLFLAGS=//Lineinput=yes≤æ≤
The Hamilton C Shell for OS/2
uses slightly different flags than the standard command processor
CMD.EXE.  Set these configuration variables to use Epsilon with the C
Shell:

Ωset EPSCOMSPEC=c:¥csh¥bin¥csh.exe≤set INTERSHELLFLAGS=-i≤set CMDSHELLFLAGS=-c≤æ≤
Note that you must type a ⁄Space€ character after the -c flag
for the Hamilton C Shell to work correctly.

These examples show the lines you would put in an autoexec.bat or
config.sys file, for the DOS and OS/2 versions of Epsilon.  For the
Windows versions, you would make corresponding entries in Epsilon's
lugeps.ini file or the system registry.  See Rconfigvarsπconfigvars.

When a concurrent process starts, Epsilon creates a buffer named
"process".  In this buffer, you can see what the process types and
respond to the process's requests for input.  If a buffer named
"process" already exists, perhaps from running a process
previously, Epsilon goes to its end.  If you set the variable
¬clear-process-buffer≈clear-process-buffer nonzero, the commands
start-process, push, and make (described
below) will each begin by emptying the process buffer.  The variable
normally has a value of 0.

A program running concurrently behaves as it does when run directly
from outside Epsilon except when it prints things on the screen or
reads characters from the keyboard.  When the program prints
characters, Epsilon inserts these in the process buffer.  When the
program waits for a line of input, Epsilon will suspend the process
until it can read a line of input from the process buffer, at which
time Epsilon will restart the process and give it the line of input.
You can type lines of input before the program requests them, and
Epsilon will feed the input to the process as it requests each line.
Under DOS, Epsilon will also satisfy requests from the concurrent
process for single-character input.

type pointIn detail, Epsilon remembers a particular spot in the process buffer
where all input and output takes place.  This spot, called the
ªtype pointº, determines what characters from the buffer a program
will read when it does input, and where the characters a program
types will appear.  Epsilon inserts in the buffer, just before the type
point, each character a program types.  When a process requests a
line of input, Epsilon waits until a newline appears in the buffer
after the type point, then gives the line to the program, then
moves the type point past these characters.  (Epsilon for DOS also
distinguishes a request by a program to read a single character.  In
that case, Epsilon will pause the concurrent process until you have
inserted a character after the type point, give that character
to the concurrent process, then advance the type point
past that character.)

You may insert characters into the process buffer in any way you
please, typing them directly or using the ¬yank command to
retrieve program input from somewhere else.  You can move about in
the process buffer, edit other files, or do anything else at any time,
regardless of whether the program has asked the system for keyboard
input.

To generate an end-of-file condition for programs reading from the
standard input, insert a ^Z character by typing Ctrl-Q Ctrl-Z on a line
by itself, at the end of the buffer.

Some programs will not work when running concurrently.  Programs that
do cursor positioning or graphics will not work well, since such
things do not correspond to a stream of characters coming from the
program to insert into a buffer.  They may even interfere with what
Epsilon displays.  We provide the concurrent process facility
primarily to let you run programs like compilers, linkers,
assemblers, filters, etc.

At this writing, there are some limitations on the types of
programs you can run under Epsilon for Windows 95/98.  Specifically,
32-bit Win32 console mode programs running concurrently under Epsilon
for Windows 95/98 cannot receive console input.  Read the release notes
to see if the current version of Epsilon still has this restriction.

environment, size ofconagent.pifIf you run Epsilon
under Windows 95/98, you may find it necessary to increase the
environment space available to a subprocess.  To do this, locate the
file conagent.pif in the directory containing Epsilon's executable
(typically c:¥Program Files¥Epsilon¥bin).
(Explorer may be set to hide the file's .pif extension.)  Display its
properties, and on the Memory tab enter a value in bytes for the
Initial Environment setting.

In some versions, Epsilon will let you run only one other program at
a time.  In others, you may rename the process buffer using the
rename-buffer command, and start a different, independent
concurrent process.  If you exit Epsilon while running a concurrent
process, Epsilon kills that process, except in the DOS version.
Epsilon for DOS will not permit you to exit until you've stopped the
concurrent process (normally by typing the "exit" command at the
end of the process buffer, or via the exit-process command).

The ¬exit-process command types "exit" to a running
concurrent process.  If the concurrent process is running a standard
command processor, it should then exit.  Under DOS, Epsilon's
¬exit command asks if you want to run exit-process
when you try to exit with a running process.

In the Windows and Unix versions of Epsilon, the ¬kill-process
command disconnects Epsilon from a concurrent process, and forces it
to exit.  It operates on the current buffer's process, if any, or on
the buffer named "process" if the current buffer has no process.

The ¬stop-process command, normally on Ctrl-C, makes a program
running concurrently believe you typed Control-Break (or, for Unix,
sends an interrupt signal).  It operates on the current buffer's
process, if any, or on the buffer named "process" if the current
buffer has no process.

Under DOS, the ¬push command on Ctrl-X Ctrl-E (which always runs a
command non-concurrently) calls exit-process if a
concurrent process is running, so it can run a process
non-concurrently.

3Compiling From Epsilon

Rscan-for-errorsMany compilers produce error messages in a
format that Epsilon can interpret with its ¬next-error command
on Ctrl-X Ctrl-N.  The command searches in the process buffer
(beginning at the place it reached last time, or at the beginning of
the last command) for a line that contains a file name, a line
number, and an error message.  If it finds one, it uses the
¬find-file command to retrieve the file (if not already in a
window), then goes to the appropriate line in the file.  With a
numeric argument, it finds the »n…th next error message, or the
»n…th previous one if negative.  In particular, a numeric argument
of 0 repeats the last message.  The ¬previous-error command on
Ctrl-X Ctrl-P works similarly, except that it searches backward
instead of forward.

Actually, Ctrl-X Ctrl-N runs the ¬next-position command, not
next-error.  The next-position command usually calls
next-error.  After you use the grep command (see Rgrepcmdπgrep-cmd), however, next-position calls
next-match instead, to move to the next match of the pattern
you searched for.  If you use any command that runs a process, or run
next-error explicitly, then next-position will again
call next-error to move to the next error message.

Similarly, Ctrl-X Ctrl-P actually runs ¬previous-position, which
decides whether to call previous-error or
previous-match based on whether you last ran a compiler or
searched across files.

MERROR_PATTERN PERROR_PATTERN, textual macroTo locate error messages, the next-error command performs
a regular-expression search using a pattern that matches most
compiler error messages.  See Rregexπregex for an explanation
of regular expressions.  The command uses the ERROR_PATTERN
macro, defined in the file proc.e.  You can change this pattern if it
doesn't match your compiler's error message format.  The
next-error command also uses another regular-expression
pattern to filter out any error messages Epsilon should skip over,
even if they match ERROR_PATTERN.  The variable
¬ignore-error≈ignore-error stores this regular expression.  For example, if
ignore-error contains the pattern ".*warning", Epsilon
will skip over any error messages that contain the word "warning".

The command ¬view-process on Shift-F3 can be convenient when
there are many long error messages in a compilation.  It pops up a
window showing the process buffer and its error messages, and lets
you move to a particular line with an error message and press
⁄Enter€.  It then goes to the source file and line in error.  You
can also use it to see the complete error message from the compiler,
when next-error's one-line display is inadequate.

The ¬make command on Ctrl-X M functions somewhat like the
push command.  It always runs a single program, rather than
an interactive command processor shell, and always captures the
output of the program, regardless of the setting of the
variable capture-output.  It automatically runs
¬next-error for you when the process returns.  By default, it
runs a program called "make", but with a numeric argument it will prompt
for the command line to execute just like the push command
does.  It will use that command line from then on, if you invoke
make without a numeric argument.

Epsilon uses a template for the command line (stored in the
¬push-cmd≈push-cmd variable), so you can define a command line that
depends on the current file name.  See Rtemplatesπtemplates for
information on templates.  For example, cl %f runs the
cl command, passing it the current file name.

If a concurrent process already exists, Epsilon will attempt to run
the program concurrently by typing its name at the end of the process
buffer.  In that case, Epsilon will run next-error only if
you've typed no keys during the execution of the concurrent program.
You can set the variable ¬concurrent-make≈concurrent-make to 0 to force Epsilon
to exit any concurrent process, before running the "make" command.
Set it to 2 to force Epsilon to run the command concurrently,
starting a new concurrent process if it needs to.  When the
variable is 1 (the default), the make command runs the
compiler concurrently if a concurrent process is already running,
non-concurrently otherwise.

Whenever push or make exit from a concurrent process
to run a command non-concurrently, they will restart the concurrent
process once the command finishes.  Set the
¬restart-concurrent≈restart-concurrent variable to zero if you don't want Epsilon
to restart the concurrent process in this case.

Before make runs the program, it checks to see if you have
any unsaved buffers.  If you do, it asks if it should save them
first, displaying the buffers using the ¬bufed command.  If
you say yes, then the make command saves all of your unsaved
buffers using the ¬save-all-buffers command (which you can also
invoke yourself with Ctrl-X S).  You can modify the
¬save-when-making≈save-when-making variable to change this behavior.  If it has
a value of 0, Epsilon won't warn you that you have unsaved buffers.
If it has a value of 1, Epsilon will automatically save all the
buffers without asking.  If it has a value of 2 (as it has normally),
Epsilon asks.

≈compile-c-cmd≈compile-eel-cmd
≈compile-java-cmd≈compile-tex-cmd
The ¬compile-buffer command on Alt-F3 is somewhat similar to
make, but tries to compile only the current file, based on
its extension.  There are several variables like
¬compile-cpp-cmd≈compile-cpp-cmd you can set to tell Epsilon the appropriate
compilation command for each extension.  If Epsilon doesn't know how
to compile a certain type of file, it will prompt for a command line.
While Epsilon's ¬make command is good for compiling entire
projects, ¬compile-buffer is handy for compiling simple,
one-file programs.

The command is especially convenient for EEL programmers because
compile-buffer automatically loads the EEL program into
Epsilon after compiling it.  In Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT, the EEL
compiler is integrated into Epsilon, so Epsilon doesn't need to run
another program to compile.  When Epsilon compiles EEL code using its
internal EEL compiler, it looks in the ¬compile-eel-dll-flags≈compile-eel-dll-flags
variable for EEL command line flags.

The buffer-specific ¬concurrent-compile≈concurrent-compile variable tells
compile-buffer whether to run the compiler concurrently.  The
value 2 means always run the compiler concurrently, 0 means
never run concurrently, and 1 means run concurrently if and only
if a concurrent process is already running.  The value 3 (the
default) means use the value of the variable concurrent-make
instead.  (The concurrent-make variable tells the make
command whether to run its program concurrently, and takes on values
of 0, 1, or 2 with the same meaning as for
concurrent-compile.)

3DOS Concurrent Process

This section applies only to the DOS version.

When you specify the name of a file to Epsilon, Epsilon interprets it
with respect to the current directory unless it begins with a slash
or backslash.  We call a file name that begins with a slash an
absolute pathname, and one that does not begin with a slash a
relative pathname.  Under most operating systems each program has its
own current directory, but DOS has only one current directory that
all programs share (well, actually one per disk drive).

Some programs temporarily change the current directory for several
seconds while the program runs.  Older versions of the DOS command
processor do this when you give a command which it cannot find in the
current directory, and have defined a directory search PATH.  If you
issue a command like find-file while running such a program
concurrently, and use a relative pathname, you may wind up with the
wrong file.  File names shown on mode lines will change to reflect
the current directory, so if a relative file name suddenly turns into
an absolute file name in a mode line, you know why.  You should wait
when DOS starts up a command if you use search paths and an older
version of DOS.
Alternatively, you can always use an absolute pathname.
This issue only arises under older versions of DOS, or with programs
that change the current directory.

Under DOS, the stop-process command will not take effect
until the program's next DOS call, exclusive of console input or
output.  If the program does no DOS calls other than typing
characters and reading characters or lines, the vanilla version of
the ¬stop-process command won't stop the program.

With a numeric argument, however, stop-process uses a
different approach, which always stops the program, but certain older
programs, if stopped in this way, crash the system.  In some versions
of DOS prior to version 3.1, the command processor exhibits this
problem.  Use stop-process with a numeric argument only after a plain
stop-process has failed to stop a program, and never with the
command processor of a version of DOS prior to version 3.1.  With a
numeric argument, stop-process can even stop programs with infinite
loops which would require rebooting outside of Epsilon.

If you've never tried a particular program before, you should make
sure to save your work before you try to run it concurrently.
Programs that use DOS for I/O generally work, whereas programs that
use the BIOS to display characters or get input will not.

Under DOS, when a concurrent process exits, Epsilon normally reclaims
the memory it used.  However, some programs leave part of themselves
in memory when they exit from their first invocation.  The DOS Print
and Mode commands do this, and some networking programs may act like
this, too.  If you run such programs from within Epsilon, Epsilon
cannot reclaim the space when the program exits.  You should run
these programs ªoutsideº Epsilon the first time you run them.

RdosmemEpsilon for DOS must divide memory between itself and a
concurrent process.  The amount of memory available to the concurrent
process depends on what types of memory are available to Epsilon
(EMS, XMS, upper memory blocks, or conventional), what command line
switches you've given, and the size of the files you're editing
before starting the process.

To ensure that Epsilon provides the maximum possible space to a
concurrent process:

 RmiszeroProvide the -m0 flag to make Epsilon use as
little memory as possible (see Rmflagπmflag).

 If Epsilon can't put its functions in XMS or EMS memory, the
process will lose about 64k of potential memory space.  If you have
an EMS memory manager program that only supports EMS 3.2, Epsilon
won't be able to use it for storing its functions.  Get a version
that supports EMS 4.0, or install an XMS memory manager.

 Make sure Epsilon doesn't have to put buffer text in
conventional memory.



Epsilon won't have to use any conventional memory for buffer text if:

 At least 128k of EMS memory is available, or

 At least 128k of XMS memory is available, and at least 64k of
memory is available in upper memory blocks.



Otherwise, Epsilon will put up to 30k of buffer text in conventional
memory.

Some programs are so big that even with -m0, they still won't
fit along with Epsilon.  Epsilon can't run such programs
concurrently, but you can run them without leaving Epsilon by having
Epsilon shrink down before running the program.  See Rshrinkingπshrinking.

2Repeating Commands
3Repeating a Single Command

numeric argumentargument,
numerickeystrokes, recordingRrepeatingYou may give any
Epsilon command a numeric argument.  Numeric arguments can go up to
several hundred million, and can have either a positive or negative
sign.  Epsilon commands, unless stated otherwise in their
description, use a numeric argument as a repetition count if this
makes sense.  For instance, forward-word goes forward 10
words if given a numeric argument of 10, or goes backward 3 words if
given a numeric argument of -3.

The ¬argument command, normally bound to Ctrl-U, specifies a
numeric argument.  After typing Ctrl-U, type a sequence of digits and
then the command to which to apply the numeric argument.  Typing a
minus sign changes the sign of the numeric argument.

You may also use the Alt versions of the digit keys (Alt-1, etc.)
with this command.  Note that by default the numeric keypad keys plus
Alt do not give Alt digits.  They produce keys like Alt-⁄PgUp€ or
let you enter special characters by their numeric code.
You can enter a numeric argument by holding down the Alt key and
typing the number on the main keyboard.  Alt-⁄Minus€ will change
the sign of a numeric argument, or start one at -4.

If you omit the digits, and just say Ctrl-U Ctrl-F, for instance,
Epsilon will provide a default numeric argument of 4 and move forward
four characters.  Typing another Ctrl-U after invoking
argument multiplies the current numeric argument by four, so
typing Ctrl-U Ctrl-U Ctrl-N will move down sixteen lines.  In general
typing a sequence of ªnº Ctrl-U's will produce a numeric argument of
4 to the n'th power.

3Keyboard Macros

keyboard macromacros,
keyboardkeystrokes, recordingRmacsEpsilon can remember a set of keystrokes, and store them away in a
ªkeyboard macroº.  Executing a keyboard macro has the same effect
as typing the characters themselves.  Use keyboard macros to make
repetitive changes to a buffer that involve the same keystrokes.  You
can even write new commands with keyboard macros.

To define a keyboard macro, use the Ctrl-X ( command.  The echo area
will display the message "Remembering", and the word
"Def" will appear in the mode line.  Whatever you type at the
keyboard gets executed as it does normally, but Epsilon also
stores the keystrokes away in the definition of the keyboard macro.

When you have finished defining the keyboard macro, press the
Ctrl-X ) key.  The echo area will display the message "Keyboard
macro defined", and a keyboard macro named ¬last-kbd-macro will
then exist with the keys you typed since you issued the Ctrl-X (
command.  To execute the macro, use the Ctrl-F4 command (or use
Ctrl-X E if you prefer).  This executes the last macro defined
from the keyboard.  If you want to repeatedly execute the macro, give
the Ctrl-F4 command a numeric argument telling how many times you
want to execute the macro.

You can give a different name to the last keyboard macro defined,
using the ¬name-kbd-macro function on Ctrl-X Alt-N.
Thereafter, you can invoke the keyboard macro by name as an extended
command.  Epsilon will even do completion on its name.  You can then
bind this new command to a key, if desired.

You can make a keyboard macro that suspends itself while running to
wait for some user input, then continues.  Press Shift-F4 while
writing the macro and Epsilon will stop recording.  Press Shift-F4
again to continue recording.  When you play back the macro, Epsilon
will stop at the same point in the macro to let you type in a file
name, do some editing, or whatever's appropriate.  Press Shift-F4 to
continue running the macro.  When a macro has been suspended,
"Susp" appears in the mode line.

Keyboard macros do not record most types of mouse operations.
Commands in a keyboard macro must be keyboard keys.  However, you can
invoke commands on a menu or tool bar while defining a keyboard
macro, and they will be recorded correctly.  While running a macro,
Epsilon's commands for killing and yanking text don't use the
clipboard; see Rclipboardπclipboard.

Instead of interactive definition with Ctrl-X (, you can also
define keyboard macros in a command file.  The details appear in the
section on command files, which appears in Rcmdfilesecπcmdfilesec.
Command files also provide a way to edit an existing macro, by
inserting it into a scratch buffer in an editable format with the
insert-macro command, modifying the macro text, then using
the load-buffer command to load the modified macro.

RmacinmacEpsilon doesn't execute a keyboard macro as it reads
the definition from a command file, like it does when you define a
macro from the keyboard.  This causes a rather subtle difference
between the two methods of definition.  Keyboard macros may contain
other keyboard macros, simply by invoking a second macro inside a
macro definition.  When you create a macro from the keyboard, the
keys you used to invoke the second macro do not appear in the macro.
Instead, the text of the second macro appears.  This allows you to
define a temporary macro, accessible with Ctrl-F4, and then
define another macro using the old macro.

With macros defined from files, this substitution does not take
place.  Epsilon makes such a macro contain exactly the keys you
specified in the file.  When you execute this macro, the inner macro
will execute at the right time, then the outer macro will continue,
just as you would expect.

The difference between these two ways of defining macros that contain
other macros shows up when you consider what happens if you redefine
the inner macro.  An outer macro defined from the keyboard remains
the same, since it doesn't contain any reference to the inner
macro, just the text of the inner macro at the time you defined
the outer one.  However, an outer macro defined from a file contains
a reference to the inner macro, by name or by a key bound to that
macro.  For this reason the altered version of the inner macro
will execute in the course of executing the outer macro.

Normally Epsilon refrains from writing to the screen during the
execution of a keyboard macro, or during typeahead.  The command
¬redisplay forces a complete rewrite of the screen.  You may
find this useful for writing macros that should update the screen in
the middle of execution.

2Simple Customizing
3Bindings

prefix keyskeys and commandsbinding commandsRbinddescrEpsilon allows you
to create your own commands and attach them, or any pre-existing
Epsilon commands, to any key.  If you bind a command to a key, you
can then invoke that command by pressing the key.  For example, at
startup, Epsilon has forward-character bound to the Ctrl-F key.
By typing Ctrl-F, the forward-character command executes, so
point moves forward one character.  If you prefer to have the command
which moves point to the end of the current line,
end-of-line, bound to Ctrl-F, you may bind that there.

You bind commands to keys with the ¬bind-to-key
command, which you can invoke with the F4 key.  The
bind-to-key command asks you for the name of a command (with
completion), and the key to which to bind that command.  You may
precede the key by any number of ªprefix keysº.  When you type a
prefix key, Epsilon asks you for another key.  For example, if you
type Ctrl-X, Epsilon asks you for another key.  Suppose you type Ctrl-O.
Epsilon would then bind the command to the Ctrl-X Ctrl-O key sequence.
Prefix keys give Epsilon a virtually unlimited number of keys.

Epsilon at startup provides Ctrl-X as the only prefix key.  You can
invoke many commands, such as save-file (Ctrl-X Ctrl-S) and
find-file (Ctrl-X Ctrl-F), through the Ctrl-X prefix key.  You may
define your own prefix keys with the command called
¬create-prefix-command.  Epsilon asks you for a key to make into
a prefix key.  You may then bind commands to keys prefixed with this
key using the bind-to-key command.  To remove prefix keys,
see Runbindprefixπunbindprefix.

When you press a prefix key, Epsilon displays the key in the echo area
to indicate that you must type another key.  Epsilon normally
displays the key immediately, but you can make it pause for a moment
before displaying the key.  If you press another key during the pause,
Epsilon doesn't bother displaying the first key.

You control the amount of time Epsilon pauses using the
¬mention-delay≈mention-delay variable, expressed in tenths of a second.  By
default, this variable has a value of zero, which indicates no delay.
You may find it useful to set
mention-delay to a small value (perhaps 3).  This delay
applies in most situations where Epsilon prompts for a single key,
such as when entering a numeric argument.

The ¬unbind-key command asks for a key and removes any binding
it may have.  It you accidentally bind a normal key like "j" to a
command, unbinding the key won't restore its original behavior of
inserting a "j".  Pressing an unbound key simply displays an error
message.  Instead, bind the "j" key to its original command
normal-character and it will again self-insert.

You may bind a given command to any number of keys.  You may invoke a
command, whether or not bound to a key, using ¬named-command, by
pressing the Alt-X key.  Alt-X asks for the name of a command, then runs
the command you specified.  This command passes any numeric argument
you give it to the command it invokes.

RaltprefixThe command ¬alt-prefix, bound to ⁄Esc€,
gets another key and executes the command bound to the Alt version of
that key.  You will find this command useful if you must use Epsilon
from a keyboard lacking a working Alt key, or if you prefer to avoid
using Alt keys.  Also, you may find some combinations of control and
alt awkward to type on some keyboards.  For example, some people
prefer to invoke the replace-string command by typing
⁄Esc€ & rather than by typing Alt-&.

The command ¬ctrl-prefix, bound to Ctrl-^, functions similarly.
It gets another key and converts it into the Control version of that
key.  For example, it changes "s" into the Ctrl-S key.

Epsilon distinguishes between upper case and lower case keys when
determining key bindings.  The command ¬case-indirect maps
upper case letters and the alt versions of upper case letters to the
corresponding lower case keys.  It also maps lower case to upper case.
If you type a key bound to case-indirect, say Alt-X, it
executes the command bound to the corresponding other key, in this
case Alt-x.  Secondary key tables like Ctrl-X usually bind the upper case
letters along with alt versions to case-indirect.  This has
the effect of making keys you bind to the lower case letters work with
both the upper and lower case letter.  You can still, however,
bind different commands to the different cases.  Note that control
keys do not have distinct cases: Ctrl-A and Ctrl-a both represent
the same key.

3Brief Emulation

Brief text editor.  The ¬brief-keyboard command loads a
Brief-style keyboard map.  To undo this change, you can use the
¬epsilon-keyboard command, which restores the standard keyboard
configuration.  This command only modifies those key combinations
that Brief uses.  Other keys retain their Epsilon definition.  The
Brief key map appears in the table.

¿Epsilon's key map for Brief emulation.¡

Rbrief-keymapIn this release, Epsilon doesn't emulate a few parts of Brief.  The
separate commands for toggling case folding and regular expressions
are not present, but you can type Ctrl-C and Ctrl-T within any searching
command to toggle those things.  Regular expressions follow Epsilon's
syntax, not Brief's.  Brief's commands for loading and saving
keyboard macro files aren't implemented, since Epsilon lets you have
an unlimited number of macros loaded at once, not just one.  Epsilon
will beep if you press the key of an unimplemented Brief emulation
command.

In Brief, the shifted arrow keys normally switch windows.  But
Epsilon adopts the Windows convention that shifted arrow keys select
text.  In Brief mode, the Alt-arrow keys on the separate cursor pad
may be used to switch windows.

You can make Epsilon's display resemble Brief's display using the
set-display-look command.  See Rsetdisplaylookπset-display-look.

¿CUA Key Assignments¡

In CUA emulation mode, Epsilon recognizes most of the key combinations
commonly used in Windows programs.  Other keys generally retain their usual
Epsilon function.

To enable this emulation, press Alt-x, then type ¬cua-keyboard and
press ⁄Enter€.  Use Alt-x ¬epsilon-keyboard ⁄Enter€ to return
to Epsilon's default key assignments.

The table shows the CUA key combinations that differ from Epsilon's native
(Emacs-style) key configuration.  In addition, various Alt-letter key
combinations not mentioned here invoke menu items (for example, Alt-F
displays the File menu in CUA mode, though it doesn't in Epsilon's native
configuration).

Many commands in Epsilon are two-key combinations starting with
Ctrl-X.  In CUA mode, use Ctrl-W instead of Ctrl-X.  For example, the
command delete-blank-lines, normally on Ctrl-X Ctrl-O, is on
Ctrl-W Ctrl-O in CUA emulation.

3Variables

hex constants, entering interactivelynumbers, entering interactivelyassigning to variablesprinting variablesdisplaying variablessetting, variablesvariables, setting & showingRvarsetting

You can set any user variable with the ¬set-variable command.
The variable must have the type ªcharº, ªshortº, ªintº,
ªarray of charsº, or ªpointer to charº.  The command first asks
you for the name of the variable to set.  You can use completion.
After you select the variable, the command asks you for the new
value.  Then the command shows you the new value.

Whenever Epsilon
asks you for a number, as in the set-variable command, it
normally interprets the number you give in base 10.  But you can
enter a number in hexadecimal (base 16) by beginning the number with
"0x", just like EEL integer constants.  The prefix "0o" means
octal, and "0b" means binary.  For example, the numbers "30",
"0x1E", "0o36", and "0b11110" all refer to the same
number, thirty.  You can also specify an ASCII value by enclosing the
character in single quotes.  For example, you could type 'a' to
specify the ASCII value of the character "a" (in this example, 97).

system variables Euser, EEL keywordThe ¬set-any-variable command is similar to set-variable,
but also includes ªsystem variablesº.  Epsilon uses system
variables to implement its commands; unless you're writing EEL
extensions, there's generally no reason to set them.  When an EEL
program defines a new variable, Epsilon considers it a system
variable unless the definition includes the user keyword.

The ¬show-variable command prompts for the name of the variable
you want to see, then displays its value in the echo area.  The same
restrictions on variable types apply here as to set-variable.
The command includes both user and system variables when it completes
on variable names.

Redit-variablesThe ¬edit-variables command in the non-GUI
versions of Epsilon lets you browse a list of all variables, showing
the current setting of each variable and the help text describing it,
as you move through the list.  You can use the arrow keys or the
normal movement keys to move around the list, or begin typing a
variable name to have Epsilon jump to that portion of the list.
Press ⁄Enter€ to set the value of the currently highlighted
variable, then edit the value shown using normal Epsilon commands.
To exit from edit-variables, press ⁄Esc€ or Ctrl-G.  With
a numeric argument, the command includes system variables in its list.

In Epsilon for Windows, the edit-variables command behaves
differently.  It uses the help system to display a list of variables.
After selecting a variable, press the Set button to alter its value.

buffer-specific variablesvariables, buffer-specificdefault
value Ebuffer, EEL keywordbuffer, storage classSome Epsilon variables
have a different value in each
buffer.  These ªbuffer-specificº variables take on a potentially
different value each time the current buffer changes.  Each
buffer-specific variable also has a default value.   Whenever you create a new buffer, you also automatically
create a new copy of the buffer-specific variable as well.  The value
of this buffer-specific variable is initially this default value.  In
Epsilon's EEL extension language, you can define a buffer-specific
variable by using the buffer storage
class specifier, and give it a
default value by initializing it like a regular variable.

window-specific variablesvariables, window-specific Ewindow, EEL keywordwindow storage classJust as Epsilon provides
buffer-specific variables, it also provides ªwindow-specificº
variables.  These have a
different value for each window. Whenever you create a new window,
you automatically create a new copy of the window-specific variable
as well.  When you split a window in two, both windows initially have
the same values for all their window-specific variables.  Each
window-specific variable also has a default value.  Epsilon uses the
default value of a window-specific variable when it creates its first
tiled window while starting up, and when it creates pop-up windows.
You define a window-specific variable in EEL with the window
storage class specifier, and you may give
it a default value by initializing it like a regular variable.

If you ask the set-variable command to set a buffer-specific
or window-specific variable, it will ask you if you mean the value
for the current buffer (or window), or the default value, or both.  You
can also tell the set-variable command which value(s) you
want to set by giving the command a numeric argument.  Zero means set
only the current value; any positive numeric argument means set both
the current and default values; and any negative numeric argument
means set only the default value.

Variables retain their values until you exit Epsilon, unless you make
the change permanent with the write-state command, described
in Rwritestateπwritestate.  This command saves only the default
value for buffer-specific and window-specific variables.  It does not
save the instantiated values of the variable for each buffer or
window, since the buffers and windows themselves aren't listed in a
state file.  Session files, which do list individual buffers and
windows, also record selected buffer-specific and window-specific
variables.

The show-variable command will generally show you both the
default and current values of a buffer-specific or window-specific
variable.  For string variables, though, the command will ask
which you want to see.

The ¬create-variable command lets you define a new variable
without using the extension language.  It asks for the name, the type,
and the initial value.

deleting commands or variablesrenaming commands or
variablesYou can delete a variable, command, macro, subroutine, or
color scheme with the ¬delete-name command, or rename one with
the ¬change-name command.  Neither of these commands will affect
any command or subroutine in use at the time you try to alter it.

3Saving Customizations

command filesstate filefile, startupstartup filessaving customizationsstate file

Epsilon can save any new bindings you have made and any macros you have
defined for future editing sessions.  Epsilon uses two kinds of files
for this purpose, the state file and the command
file.  They both save bindings and macros, but they differ in many
respects:

 A state file contains commands, macros, variables, and bindings.
A command file can contain only macros and bindings.

 When Epsilon writes a state file, all currently defined commands,
macros and variables go into it.  A command file contains just what
you put there.

 Epsilon can only read a state file during startup.  It makes
the new invocation of Epsilon have the same commands as the Epsilon
that performed the ¬write-state command that created that
state file.  By contrast, Epsilon can load a command file at any time.

 A command file appears in a human-readable format, so you
can edit it as a normal file.  By contrast, Epsilon stores a state file
in a non-human readable format.  To modify a state file, you
read it into a fresh Epsilon, use appropriate Epsilon commands (like
bind-to-key to change bindings), then save the state
with the ¬write-state command.

 Epsilon can read a state file much faster than a command file.



You would use
command files mostly for editing macros.  They also provide
compatibility with previous versions of Epsilon, which did not offer
state files.  The next section describes command files.

RwritestateThe ¬write-state command on Ctrl-F3 asks for
the name of a file, and writes the current state to that file.  The
file name has its extension changed to ".sta" first, to indicate a
state file.  If you don't provide a name, Epsilon uses the name
"epsilon.sta", the same name that it looks for at startup.  You can
specify another state file for Epsilon to use at startup with the
-s flag.

For example, say Tom and Sue share a computer.  Tom likes Epsilon
just the way it comes, but Sue has written some new
commands and attached them to the function keys, and she now wants to
use those commands each time she uses Epsilon.  She invokes
write-state and gives the file name "sue".  Epsilon writes
all its commands and bindings on a file named "sue.sta".  She can
now invoke Epsilon with her commands by typing "epsilon -ssue".
Or, she can use a configuration variable to specify this switch
automatically every time she runs Epsilon.  See Repsenvvarπepsenvvar.

By default, when you write a new state file, Epsilon makes a copy of
the old one in a file named ebackup.sta.
You can turn backups off by setting the variable
¬want-state-file-backups≈want-state-file-backups to 0, or change the backup file name by
modifying the ¬state-file-backup-name≈state-file-backup-name template.  See Rtemplatesπtemplates for information on templates.

3Command Files

stringscommand filesRcmdfilesRcmdfilesecEpsilon provides several
commands to create and execute ªcommand filesº.  These files
contain macro definitions and key bindings in a human-readable
format, as described below.  The ¬load-file command asks you for
the name of a file, then executes the commands contained in it.  The
¬load-buffer command asks you for the name of a buffer, then
executes the commands contained in that buffer.

Epsilon's command files appear in a human-readable format, so you can
easily modify them.  Parentheses surround each command.  Inside the
parentheses appear a command name, and one or two ªstringsº,
sections of text enclosed in double quotes (").  Spaces
separate one field from the next.  Thus, each command looks something
like this:

Ωbind-to-key command, in command filecommand file, bind-to-key(command-name "first-string" "second-string") æ

You can include comments in a command file by putting a semicolon or
hash sign ("#") anywhere an opening parenthesis may appear.  Such a
comment extends to the end of the line.  Note that you cannot put a
comment inside a string.

Command files may contain three types of commands.
The first,
ªbind-to-keyº, functions like the regular Epsilon command of the same
name.  For bind-to-key, the first string specifies the name of some Epsilon
command, and the second string represents the key whose binding you
wish to modify, in a format we'll describe in detail in a moment. For
instance, the following command binds the command
show-matching-delimiter to }:

ΩRunbindprefixprefix keys, unbinding;  This example binds show-matching-delimiter to the≤;  } character so that typing a } shows the matching≤;  { character.≤(bind-to-key "show-matching-delimiter" "}")≤æ≤
Unlike the regular command version, bind-to-key
in a command file can unbind a
prefix key.  Say you want to make Ctrl-X no longer function as a prefix
key, but instead have it invoke down-line.  If, from the
keyboard, you typed F4 to invoke bind-to-key, supplied the
command name down-line, and then typed Ctrl-X as the key to
rebind, Epsilon would assume you meant to rebind some ªsubcommandº
of Ctrl-X, and wait for you to type a Ctrl-K, for instance, to bind
down-line to Ctrl-X Ctrl-K.  Epsilon doesn't know you have finished
typing the key sequence.  But in a command file, quotes
surround each of the arguments to bind-to-key.  Because of this,
Epsilon can tell exactly where a key sequence ends, and you could
rebind Ctrl-X as above (discarding the bindings available through Ctrl-X in
the process) by saying:

Ωdefine-macro, in command filecommand
file, define-macrocreate-prefix-command command, in command filecommand file, create-prefix-command(bind-to-key "down-line" "C-X") æ

In a command file, ªdefine-macroº allows you to
define a keyboard macro.  Its first string specifies the name of the
new Epsilon command to define, and its second string specifies the
sequence of keys you want the command to type.  The define-macro
command does not correspond to any single regular Epsilon command,
but functions like a combination of start-kbd-macro,
end-kbd-macro, and name-kbd-macro.

The third command file
command, ªcreate-prefix-commandº, takes a single string, which
specifies a key, and makes that key a prefix character.  It works
just as the regular command of the same name does.

The strings that describe keys in each of these commands use a
representation similar to what Epsilon uses when it refers to some
key.  Normal characters represent themselves, control characters
have a "C-" before them, alt characters have an "A-", and
function keys have an "F-" followed by the number of the function
key.  Cursor keys appear in a notation like <Home>.
See Rkeynamesπkeynames for details.

In practice, you don't need to remember exactly how to refer to a
particular key, because Epsilon provides commands that construct
command files for you.  See the insert-macro and
insert-binding commands, described below.

You can also use the special syntax
<!»cmdname…> in a keyboard macro to run
a command »cmdname… without knowing which key it's bound to.  For
example, <!find-file> runs the find-file
command.  When you define a keyboard macro interactively and invoke
commands from the menu bar or tool bar, Epsilon will use this syntax
to define them, since there may be no key sequence that invokes the
specified command.

Do not put extra spaces in command file strings that represent keys.
For example, the string "C-X F" represents
"C-X <Space> F", not "C-X F" with no
⁄Space€.  When Epsilon describes a multi-key sequence to you
(during help, for example), it typically puts in spaces for
readability.

If a backslash character "¥" appears in a string, it removes any
special meaning from the character that follows.  For instance, to
make a string with a quote character (") the sequence """ doesn't
work, because Epsilon interprets it as a string, followed by a quote.
Instead, use "¥"".

If you need a string with the character "<" or the
sequence "C-" in it (or "A-", "S-", "F-" or "N-"),
you'll need to put a backslash (¥) before it, to prevent its
interpretation as a Control, Alt or other special character.  You can
get a backslash in a string with a pair of backslashes, the first
preventing special interpretation of the second.  Thus, the DOS file
name ¥job¥letter.txt in a string looks like
¥¥job¥¥letter.txt.

Consider this example command file:

Ωscroll-next-window Cscroll-next-window, command; This macro makes the window below the≤; current one advance to the next page.≤(define-macro "scroll-next-window" "C-XnC-VC-Xp")≤(bind-to-key "scroll-next-window" "C-A-v")≤≤;This macro asks for a file and puts≤;it in another window.≤(define-macro "split-and-find" "A-Xsplit-window≤A-Xredisplay≤A-Xfind-file≤")≤æ≤
The first two lines contain comments.  The third line begins the
definition of a macro called scroll-next-window.  It
contains three commands. First Ctrl-x n invokes next-window, to move
to the next window on the screen.  The Ctrl-v key runs next-page,
scrolling that window forward, and Ctrl-x p then invokes
previous-window, to return to the original window.  The fourth
line of this example binds this new macro to the Ctrl-Alt-v key, so that
from then on, typing a "v" with Control and Alt depressed will scroll
the next window forward.

split-and-find Csplit-and-find, commandThe file defines a second macro named split-and-find.  It
invokes three commands by name.  Notice that the macro could have
invoked two of the commands by key.  Invoking by name makes the macro
easier to read and modify later.  The redisplay command shows
the action of split-window before the find-file
command prompts the user for a file name.

Rather than preparing command files according to the rules presented
here, you may wish to have Epsilon write parts of them automatically.
Epsilon has two commands that produce the special
bind-to-key and define-macro commands appropriate to
recreate a current binding or macro.

The ¬insert-binding command asks you for a key, and
inserts a bind-to-key command into the current buffer.  When you load
the command buffer, Epsilon will restore the binding of that key.

The ¬insert-macro command creates an appropriate define-macro
command for a macro whose name you specify, and inserts the
command it builds into the current buffer.  This comes in handy for editing a
keyboard macro that already exists.

In addition to the above syntax with commands inside parentheses,
command files may contain special lines that define variables,
macros, key tables or bindings.  Epsilon understands all the
different types of lines generated by the list-all and
list-colors commands.  Let's say you want to create a command
file with many different macros or bindings you've defined in the
current session.  You could type the command file in manually, or you
could use the ¬insert-binding and ¬insert-macro commands
described above to write the command file line by line.  But you may
find it easier to run list-all, and then extract just the
lines you want.

Besides listing variables, macros, key tables, and bindings, the
list-all command also creates lines that report that a
command or subroutine with a particular name exists.  These lines
give the name, but not the definition.  When Epsilon sees a line like
that, it makes sure that a command or subroutine with the given name
exists.  If not, it reports an error.  Epsilon does the same thing
with variables that have complicated types (pointers or structures,
for example).

3Using International Characters

graphics charactersdiacritical
marksinternational charactersforeign
charactersnon-english charactersThis section explains how to
configure Epsilon to conveniently edit text containing non-English
characters such as Í or Â.

First, make sure Epsilon displays international characters using the
correct graphic.  Epsilon does this by default, but it's possible to
use the set-show-graphic command to change this.  If
international characters display with multi-character representations
like M-^H or xCE, see Rsetshowgraphicπset-show-graphic.

Epsilon automatically recognizes most international characters when
you type them normally.  You can ignore the rest of this section
unless you have trouble typing international characters in Epsilon.

With some national keyboards, to type certain characters you must
hold down the Alt key, and enter the key code numerically on the
keypad.  By default, this doesn't work in Epsilon for DOS or OS/2.
To make it work, run the program-keys command.  Then select
the A option.  (See Rprogkeysπprog-keys.)  Instead of making
this change, you can use Epsilon's insert-ascii command on
Alt-# to enter a code by number.  See Rinsertasciiπinsert-ascii.  If
you often enter the same character in this way, a keyboard macro can
make this more convenient.  See Rmacsπmacs.

You may find that when you type a certain international character,
Epsilon beeps, or runs an unexpected command, or something similar.
The character might happen to use the same code as an Epsilon
command.  You can fix this problem in two steps.

Under DOS, run the program-keys command, and select the I
option to modify the translation of an individual key.  Now press the
troublesome key.  Epsilon will display a message such as "Key Alt-+,
#299 is translated to Alt-+, #299 - change?"  Press Y to change
the key's translation, and enter -1 as the key's new translation.

If you don't use DOS, or the above procedure didn't work, you'll have
to rebind the key.  (See Rbindingsπbindings.)  To do this, press
F4 to run the bind-to-key command.  It will ask for the name
of a command to bind.  Type normal-character and press
⁄Enter€.  It will then ask you to press the key you want to
rebind.  Press the troublesome key.  This should fix the problem.
Because this procedure replaces key bindings, you may find that
typing a command's key sequence unexpectedly inserts a national
character.  You can bind the unbound command to another key, or run
it by name.

2Advanced Topics
3Changing Commands with EEL

bytecode filesEpsilon Extension LanguageEELEpsilon has many built-in commands, but you may want to add new
commands, or modify the way some commands work.  We used a language
called EEL to write all
of Epsilon's commands.  You can find the EEL definitions to all of
Epsilon's commands in files ending in ".e".  EEL stands for Epsilon
Extension Language.

Before you can load a group of commands from a
".e" file into Epsilon, you must compile them with the EEL
compiler.  You do this (outside of Epsilon, or in Epsilon's
concurrent process buffer) by giving the command "eel »filename…"
where »filename… specifies the name of the ".e" file you wish to
compile (with or without the ".e").  The EEL compiler will read the
source file and, if it finds no errors, will produce a "bytecode"
file with the same first name but with a ".b" extension.  A
bytecode file contains command, subroutine, and variable definitions
from the source file translated to a binary form that Epsilon can
understand.  It's similar to a regular compiler's object file.

Once you've compiled the file, the Epsilon ¬load-bytes command,
bound to F3, gets it into Epsilon.  This command prompts for a file
name, then loads it into Epsilon.  You may omit the extension.

If you're currently editing an EEL source file, you can compile and
load it in one step using the compile-buffer command on
Alt-F3.  See Rcompilebufferπcompile-buffer.

Rdebugdebuggertracing debuggerOften a new EEL
command won't work the first time.  Epsilon incorporates a simple
debugger to help you trace through the execution of a command.  It
provides single-stepping by source line, and you can enter a
recursive edit level to locate point or to run test functions.
The debugger takes the following commands:
Œ⁄Space€ Step to the next line.
This command will trace a function call only
if you have enabled debugging for that function.

ŒS If the current line calls a function, step to its first line.
Otherwise, step to the current function's next line.

ŒG Cancel debugging for the rest of this function call and let
the function run.  Resume debugging if someone calls the current
function again.

ŒR Begin a recursive edit of the current buffer.  You may
execute any command, including show-variable or
set-variable.  Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z resumes debugging the stopped
function.  (When debugging a function doing input, you may need to
type Ctrl-U Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z to resume debugging.)

ŒT Toggle whether or not the current function should start the
debugger when called the next time.  Parentheses appear around the word
"Debug" in the debug status line to indicate that you have not enabled
debugging for the current function.

Œ+ Enlarge the debug window.

Œ- Shrink the debug window.

Œ? List all debugger commands.


To start the debugger, use the ¬set-debug command.  It asks for
the name of a command or subroutine, providing completion, and
toggles debugging for that function.  (A zero numeric argument
turns off debugging for that function.  A nonzero numeric argument
turns it on.  Otherwise, it toggles.)

Under DOS or OS/2, you can also start the debugger by pressing
Control-⁄Break€ during the execution of a command.  (Under OS/2,
you must then select the D option.)

Compiling a file with the -s EEL compiler flag disables
debugging for routines defined in that file.  See Reelflagsπeelflags for information about the EEL command line
options, including the -s flag.

The ¬profile command shows where a command spends its time.
When you invoke the profile command, it starts a recursive edit
level, and collects timing information.  Many times each second,
Epsilon notes the source file and source line of the EEL code then
executing.  When you exit from the recursive edit with Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z,
Epsilon displays the information to you in a buffer.

Epsilon doesn't collect any profiling information on commands
or subroutines that you compile with the -s EEL flag.  Epsilon
for Windows 3.1 doesn't support profiling.

The ¬list-undefined command makes a list of EEL functions that
are called from some other EEL function, but have no definition.
These are typically the result of misspelled function names.

3Updating from an Old Version

update Epsilonupdating EpsilonRupdatingA new
version of Epsilon often has a different internal format for the
bytecode and state files it uses.  If you have customized Epsilon,
you'll probably want to incorporate your changes into the new
version.  This section describes how to do this with a minimum of
trouble.  If you want to preserve your changes, please read it before
overwriting your existing copy of Epsilon with a new version.

If you've changed Epsilon by writing commands in Epsilon's extension
language, EEL, you should recompile them using the new EEL compiler
and load them into Epsilon.  (If some of your commands have cursor
key bindings, and you want to update from version 4.4 or earlier, use
the ¬eel-change-key-names command on your EEL files before
compiling them, as described at the end of this section.)  If some of
the built-in functions or subroutines you call have changed, you will
have to modify your commands to take this into account.  Look in the
file "from»version…" for a list of changes, where »version…
represents the old version number.  (Find the closest file to your
version.  If you had version 3.23, for example, you would use the
file "from32", since we do not provide a "from323").  The
installation process normally installs these files in the
\epsilon\changes directory.

Other types of changes you might make include setting variables,
changing bindings, or adding macros.  To move these changes to the
new version requires several steps.

 Start the old version of Epsilon as you do normally.

 key-switch Ckey-switch, commandTo update from a Unix version of Epsilon
prior to version 4.05, issue the key-switch command and give
the name "xxxx" when it asks for the terminal to switch to.  This
ensures that Epsilon records your key bindings in a
terminal-independent manner.

 Run the ¬list-all command.  Epsilon provides this command
starting with version 4.0.  If you have an older version of Epsilon,
see the end of this section.

°This will make a list of all the variables, bindings, macros, and
functions defined in your old version of Epsilon.

 Save the result in a file.  We will assume you wrote it to a
file named "after".

 You should no longer need the old version of Epsilon, so you
can now install the new version in place of the old one if you wish.
Or you can install the new version in a separate directory.

 RfindchangesLocate the "changes" subdirectory
\epsilon\changes.



For each old version of Epsilon, you'll need several files in
the steps below.  In the description that follows, we will assume
that you want to move from Epsilon 3.2 to this version, and will use
files with names like list32.std.  Substitute the correct file name if
you have a different version (for example, list31.std to
upgrade from Epsilon 3.1).

 Locate the file in the changes subdirectory with a name like
list32.std.  It resembles the "after" file, but comes from an
unmodified copy of that version of Epsilon.  We will call this the
"before" file.  See the end of this section if there is none.

 Start the new version of Epsilon.  Run the list-changes
command.  It will ask for the names of the "before" and "after"
files, and will then make a list of differences between the files.
When it finishes, you will have a list of the changes you made to the
old version of Epsilon, in the format used by the list-all
command.  Edit this to remove changes you don't want in the new
version, and save it.

 To update from version 4.4 or earlier, load the
bytecode file called newkeys.b in the changes subdirectory, using the
load-bytes command on key F3.  Now you can run the
¬change-key-names command to convert any old-style key names
such as N-3 to their new names (in this case, <PgDn>).

 Run the load-changes command, and give it the name of
the "changes" file from the previous step.  It will load the
changes into Epsilon.  You can define commands, subroutines, and some
variables only from a compiled EEL file, not via
load-changes.  If any of these appear in your changes file,
Epsilon will add a comment after that line, stating why it couldn't
make the change.

 Use the write-state command to save your new version of
Epsilon.  (Epsilon will automatically make a backup copy of your old
state file.)



Note that this procedure will not spot changes made in .e files, only
those made to variables, bindings or macros.  It will notice if you
have defined a new command, but not if you have modified an existing
command.

The above procedure uses several commands.  The ¬list-all
command lists the current state of Epsilon in text form, mentioning
all commands and subroutines, and describing all key bindings,
macros, and variables.  The ¬list-changes command accepts the
names of the "before" and "after" files produced by
list-all, and runs the compare-sorted-windows command
on them to make a list of the lines in "after" that don't match a line
in "before".

Finally, the ¬load-changes command reads this list of
differences and makes each modification listed.  It knows how to
create variables, define macros, and make bindings, but it can't
transfer extension-language commands.  You'll have to use the new EEL
compiler to incorporate any EEL extensions you wrote.

4Importing Color Settings

Starting in version 8.0, Epsilon records color selections in an EEL
extension language file.  Once your color changes are in an EEL file,
you'll be able to move them to a new version of Epsilon by simply
recompiling them.  When you move from an older version of Epsilon to
version 8.0 or later, you'll need to create this EEL file.

Use the ¬import-colors command to import your color choices from
Epsilon 7.X or earlier versions.  It reads the same "changes" file
as load-changes and builds an EEL file named mycolors.e,
which you can compile and load into Epsilon with the
compile-buffer command on Alt-F3.

If you're updating from Epsilon 8.0, your color changes should
already be in an EEL file.  Simply compile and load this file into
the new version of Epsilon.  Starting in Epsilon 9.0, you can
generate a mycolors.e file from Epsilon's current color settings
using the ¬export-colors command.

Once you've loaded your color choices, you may need to use the
set-color command to select the particular color scheme you
modified.  Import-colors doesn't change which color scheme
Epsilon uses, only the color choices making up the scheme.

4Updating from Epsilon 4

If you're updating from a version of Epsilon before 4.0, you'll have
to make several files before updating.  You will need your old
version of Epsilon (including the executable program files for
Epsilon and EEL), the state file you've been using with it (typically
named epsilon.sta), and the original state file that came with that
version of Epsilon (which you can find on your old Epsilon
distribution disk).  You'll also need the file list-all.e, included
with the new version of Epsilon.  First, read the comments in the
file list-all.e and edit it as necessary to match your version.  Then
compile it with the old EEL compiler.  This will create the bytecode
file list»version….b.  Start your old version of Epsilon with its
original state file, using a command like epsilon -s¥oldver¥epsilon, and load the bytecode file you just created,
using the load-bytes command on the F3 key.  Now save the
resulting list in a file named "before".  Then start your old
version of Epsilon again, this time with your modified state file,
and load the bytecode file list»version….b again.  Now save the
resulting list in a file named "after".  Next, start the new
version of Epsilon, read in the "before" file, and sort using the
sort-buffer command, and write it back to the "before"
file.  You can now continue with the procedure above, running the
list-changes command and providing the two files you just
created.

If we didn't provide a .std file for your version of Epsilon, and
you're running Epsilon 4.0 or later, here's how to make one.  You
will need your old version of Epsilon, the state file you've been
using with it (typically named epsilon.sta), and the original state
file that came with that version of Epsilon (which you can find on
your old Epsilon distribution disk).  Start your old version of
Epsilon with its original state file, using a command like epsilon
-s¥oldver¥epsilon, and run the list-all
command.  Now save the resulting list in a file named "before".
Then start your old version of Epsilon again (just as you normally
do) using the state file that contains the changes you've made, and
run the list-all command again.  Now save the resulting list
in a file named "after".  Next, start the new version of Epsilon,
read in the "before" file, and sort using the sort-buffer
command, and write it back to the "before" file.  You can now
continue with the procedure above, running the list-changes
command and providing the two files you just created.

change-key-nameseel-change-key-names Cchange-key-names, command Ceel-change-key-names, commandThe commands change-key-names and
eel-change-key-names mentioned above replace old-style
cursor key names from Epsilon 4.4 and earlier with the new names for
these keys.  The latter command transforms key names that appear in
EEL program syntax (for example, converting NUMDIGIT(0) to
KEYINSERT).  Use the former command to convert command files
and before/after lists (in which N-7 becomes <Home>).  Before you
can run these commands, you must load the bytecode file newkeys.b
from the "changes" subdirectory described in Rfindchangesπfindchanges, using the load-bytes command on key
F3.

3Keys and their Representation

ASCII charactersRkeynamesThis section describes the legal Epsilon keys, and
the representation that Epsilon uses when referring to keys and
reading command files.  The key representation used when writing
extension language programs appears in Reelkeysπeelkeys.

Epsilon recognizes a total of 684 distinct keys you can type on the
keyboard (including control and alt keys).  You can bind a command to
each of these keys.  Each key can also function as a prefix key to
allow an additional 684 keys accessible through that key.

First, the keyboard provides the standard 128
ASCII characters.  All the white keys in the central part of the PC
keyboard, possibly in combination with the Shift and Control keys,
generate ASCII characters.  So do the ⁄Esc€, ⁄Backspace€,
⁄Tab€, and ⁄Enter€ keys.  They generate Control [,
Control H, Control I, and Control M, respectively.  Depending upon
the national-language keyboard driver in use, there may be up to 128
additional keys available by pressing various combinations of Control
and AltGr keys, for a total of 256 keys.

Ω– 4 16 28 40 <Ins><Insert><End><Down><PgDn><PageDn><PgDown><PageDown><Left><Right><Home><Up><PgUp><PageUp><Del><Delete>—æ

¿Names Epsilon uses for the cursor keypad keys.¡

RsepkeysYou can get an additional 256 keys by holding down the Alt key while
typing the above keys.  In Epsilon, you can also enter an Alt key by
typing an ⁄Esc€ before the key.  Similarly, the Control-^ key
says to interpret the following key as if you had held down the
Control key while typing that key.

If you want to enter an actual ⁄Esc€ or Control-^ instead,
type a Control-Q before it.  The Ctrl-Q key "quotes" the following key
against special interpretations.  See Raltprefixπaltprefix.

In command files and some other contexts, Epsilon represents Control
keys by C-⁄char€, with ⁄char€ replaced by the original key.
Thus Control-t appears as C-T.  The case of the ⁄char€
doesn't matter for control characters when Epsilon reads a command
file, but the C- must appear in upper case.  The Delete character
(ASCII code 127) appears as C-?.  Note that this has nothing to do
with the key marked "Del" on the PC keyboard.  The Alt keys appear
with A- appended to the beginning of their usual symbol, as in A-f
for Alt-f and A-C-h for Alt-Control-H.

function keysEpsilon represents function keys by F-1, F-2,
... F-12.  The F must appear in upper case.  You can also specify
the Shift, Control, and Alt versions of the function keys.  When
typing a function key, Epsilon only recognizes one "modifier."  If
you press the Alt key down, Epsilon ignores the Control and Shift
keys, and if you press the Control key down, Epsilon ignores the
Shift key.  You can specify 48 keys in this way.  In a command file,
you specify the Shift, Control, and Alt versions with a prefix of S-,
C-, or A-, respectively.  For example, Epsilon refers to the key you
get by holding down the Shift and Alt keys and pressing the F8 key as
A-F-8.

Keys on the cursor keypad work in a similar way.  Epsilon recognizes
several synonyms for these keys, as listed in the table.
Epsilon generally uses the first name listed, but will accept any of
the names from a command file.  Epsilon recognizes Control, Shift, and Alt
versions of these keys as well, and indicates these with a prefix of
C-, S-, or A-, respectively.  You can only use one of these prefixes at a
time.

Epsilon normally treats the shifted versions of these keys as
synonyms for the unshifted versions.  When you press
Shift-⁄Left€, Epsilon runs the command bound to ⁄Left€.  The
commands bound to most of these keys then examine the Shift key and
decide whether to begin or stop selecting text.  (Holding down the
shift key while using the cursor keys is one way to select text in
Epsilon.)  In a macro, Epsilon indicates that a cursor key was
shifted using the E- prefix.  You can make Epsilon treat shifted
cursor keys as entirely separate keys using the
program-keys command, described in the next section.

 F-ke, command line flagEpsilon doesn't distinguish between the keys of a separate cursor pad
and those of the numeric key pad unless you use the -ke switch,
described in Rkflagπkflag.  If you use -ke, Epsilon refers
to the numeric keypad keys with the names given in the table.  Whether or not you use -ke, Epsilon refers
to the numeric keypad's 5 key (which doesn't exist on the cursor pad)
as N-5.

Epsilon actually does distinguish between the numeric pad and the
cursor pad, even if you don't use -ke, in one case.  Under DOS
and OS/2, you can use the ¬program-keys command to enable
entering graphic characters by holding down Alt and typing their
codes on the numeric keypad (see Rprogkeysπprog-keys).  That
won't affect the Alt versions of the cursor pad keys.  You can still
bind Epsilon commands to those keys.

¿Numeric keypad key names recognized and displayed by Epsilon.¡

RnumkeypadkeysThe numeric keypad has a dual nature, in that it can function as both
a cursor pad and a numeric pad.  The ⁄Num Lock€ key switches between
these two functions.  You can temporarily change the state of
⁄Num Lock€ with either Shift key.  With the Control or Alt keys
depressed, Epsilon always generates cursor keys, and ignores the
⁄Num Lock€ and Shift keys.

Caps Lock keyAs usual, the ⁄Caps Lock€ key reverses the action of the shift
key when used to modify alphabetic characters.

In a command file, you can also represent keys by their conventional
names, by writing <Newline> or <Escape>, or by number,
writing <#0> for the null character ^@, for example.
Epsilon understands the same key names here as in regular expression
patterns (see the table in Rregcharsπregchars).

Macros defined in command files may also use the syntax
<!»cmdname…> to run
a command »cmdname… without knowing which key it's bound to.  For
example, <!find-file> runs the find-file
command.  When you define a keyboard macro interactively and invoke
commands from the menu bar or tool bar, Epsilon will use this syntax
to define them, since there may be no key sequence that invokes the
specified command.

Several keys on the PC keyboard act as synonyms for other keys: the
grey keys *, -, and + by the numeric keypad, and the
⁄Backspace€, ⁄Enter€, ⁄Tab€, and ⁄Esc€ keys.  The
first three act as synonyms for the regular white ASCII keys, and the
other four act as synonyms for the Control versions of "H", "M", "I"
and "[", respectively.  Epsilon normally translates these keys
to their synonyms automatically, but you can change this using the
program-keys command, described in the next section.

Under DOS, the ⁄Scroll Lock€ key halts the currently
running command, if possible, just like the ¬abort command.
The command itself must
check for an abort
request (as most commands that take a long time do).  Control-⁄Scroll
Lock€ starts the extension language debugger on the currently
running function.  For this to work, you need to have
compiled the function using EEL's -s flag.

Under OS/2, ⁄Scroll Lock€ does nothing.  Control-⁄Scroll Lock€ asks
you whether to abort the current command like abort, start the
extension language debugger, immediately exit Epsilon, or do nothing.

You cannot bind commands to the special
⁄Scroll Lock€ and Control-⁄Scroll Lock€ keys.
They always behave as described.

4Mouse Keys

When you use the mouse, Epsilon generates a special key code for each
mouse event and handles it the same way as any other key.  (For mouse
events, Epsilon also sets certain variables that indicate the
position of the mouse on the screen, among other things.  See Rcatchmouseπcatch-mouse.)

Ω– 2 16 30 44 M-<Left>M-<LeftUp>M-<DLeft>M-<Move>M-<Center>M-<CenterUp>M-<DCenter>M-<Right>M-<RightUp>M-<DRight>—æ

Epsilon uses the above names for mouse keys when it displays key
names in help messages and similar contexts.  M-<Left> indicates
a click of the left button, M-<LeftUp> indicates a release, and
M-<DLeft> a double-click.  See Rcustommouseπcustom-mouse before
binding new commands to these keys.

Epsilon doesn't record mouse keys in keyboard macros.  Use the
equivalent keyboard commands when defining a macro.

There are several "input events" that Epsilon records as special
key codes.  Their names are listed below.  See Rwinkeysπwinkeys
for information on the meaning of each key code.

Ω– 2 16 30 48 M-<MenuSel>M-<HScroll>M-<WinHelpReq>M-<LoseFocus>M-<Resize>M-<DragDrop>M-<Button>M-<VScroll>M-<WinExit>M-<GetFocus>—æ

Under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT, Epsilon displays a tool bar.  The
¬toggle-toolbar command hides or displays the tool bar.  To
modify the contents of the tool bar, see the definition of the
¬standard-toolbar command in the file menu.e, and the
description of the tool bar primitive functions in Rtoolbarprimsπtoolbarprims.

The ¬invoke-windows-menu command brings up the Windows system
menu.  Alt-⁄Space€ is bound to this command.  If you bind this
command to an alphabetic key like Alt-P, it will bring up the
corresponding menu (the Process menu, in this example).

In a typical Windows program, pressing and releasing the Alt key
without pressing any other key moves to the menu bar, highlighting
its first entry.  Set the variable ¬alt-invokes-menu≈alt-invokes-menu to one if
you want Epsilon to do this.  The variable has no effect on what
happens when you press Alt and then press another key before
releasing Alt: this will run whatever command is bound to that key.
If you want Alt-E, for example, to display the Edit menu, you can
bind the command invoke-windows-menu to it.

3Altering Keys

Rprog-keysThis section describes Epsilon's facilities for
internally altering the keys you type.  You might need to do this to
make Epsilon for DOS work with a TSR program or to force it recognize a
nonstandard key combination.  Epsilon has a general-purpose low-level
facility called the keytran≈keytran array to do this (see Rkeytranπkeytran).  The ¬program-keys command presents
a menu of options, listing some typical customizations you may need
to do.
resident
utilitiespop-up utilitiesTSR'sŒ1, 2, 3 ... Under DOS, Epsilon uses several
"nonstandard" keys such as the Alt-⁄Period€ key and the
Ctrl-⁄Up€ key.  A few resident utility programs (also known
as keyboard enhancers, Pop-up utilities, and TSR's) use the same
nonstandard keys that the DOS version of Epsilon uses.  Normally,
Epsilon keeps these keys for its own use, and resident programs won't
see them.  The numbered options of program-keys instruct
Epsilon to release the conflicting keys used by several resident
programs.  Epsilon will then pass these keys to the resident program
instead of using these keys itself.

keyboard, enhancersPresentation Manager, OS/2 keysPM, OS/2
keysOS/2 Presentation Manager keyskeys, OS/2
Presentation ManagerŒA Both DOS and OS/2 allow you to enter graphic characters by
holding down the Alt key and typing their decimal codes on the
numeric keypad.  However, Epsilon normally binds commands to these
keys.  The "A" options tells Epsilon you want to enter graphic
characters numerically in this way.  (Note: Epsilon for Windows
always acts as if you had selected this option.  So does Epsilon for
OS/2, when running in an OS/2 Presentation Manager
window.) You can also enter a character by its decimal
code using the insert-ascii command.

ŒI Use this option if you must alter the translations of
individual keys.  Epsilon will ask you to press a key, show you the
current translation of that key, and ask for a new translation.

¢To replace one key with another, use the I option to determine the
numeric code of the replacement key.  Then use the I option again and
press the key you want to modify.  Press Y to enter a new translation
for the key.  Then enter the numeric code of the replacement key.

¢You can also use this facility to defeat the automatic replacement
that the computer's BIOS does (in the DOS version), forcing Epsilon
to distinguish between two keys when the BIOS considers them
identical.  To do this, use the I option to select the key you want
to modify.  When Epsilon asks for the new translation value, type in
the same number shown as the key's code.  For example, to make
Epsilon distinguish Shift-⁄GreyPlus€, shown as key number 579,
change its translation from the default value of -1 to 579.

¢Sometimes you have to do just the opposite.  By default, a key like
Alt-< (key number 316) has a translation code of 316, telling
Epsilon to retain the key and not pass it to the BIOS (DOS version
only).  Epsilon does this because the BIOS ignores this key
combination.  Similarly, the BIOS normally changes the key
combination Alt-# (key number 291) into Alt-3 (the unshifted form).  So
Epsilon sets its translation to 291 so the BIOS never sees it.  But
sometimes TSR programs watch for a particular key combination,
typically one the BIOS doesn't recognize.  You may have to tell
Epsilon to pass such a key combination through, so that the TSR
program can see it.  Do this by setting the key's translation to
-1.  The numbered options of program-keys described
above do this, for the special keys used by some common TSR programs.

¢There are a few other things you can do with key translation codes.
See the description of the keytran≈keytran array in Rkeytranπkeytran for more details.

ŒD This option restores Epsilon to its default state, undoing
all the changes you've made with these options.

ŒQ This option exits the program-keys command.

3Customizing the Mouse

 Cmouse-left-hook, commandmouse-left-hookRcustom-mouseYou can rebind the mouse buttons in the same way
as other keys using the ¬bind-to-key command, but if, for
example, you rebind the left mouse button to copy-region,
then that button will copy the region from point to mark, regardless
of the location of the mouse.  Instead, you might want to use the
left button to select a region, and then copy that region.  To do
this, leave the binding of the left mouse button alone, and instead
define a new version of the mouse-left-hook function.  By
default, this is a subroutine that does nothing.  You can redefine it
as a keyboard macro using the ¬name-kbd-macro command.  Epsilon
runs this hook function after you release the left mouse button, if
you've used the mouse to select text or position point (but not if,
for example, you've clicked on the scroll bar).

Normally Epsilon runs the ¬mouse-select command when you click
or double-click the left mouse button, and the ¬mouse-to-tag
command when you click or double-click the right mouse button.
Epsilon runs the ¬mouse-move command when you move the mouse;
this is how it changes the mouse cursor shape or pops up a scroll bar
or menu bar when the mouse moves to an appropriate part of the screen
under DOS or OS/2.

mouse-right-hookmouse-center-hook Cmouse-right-hook, command Cmouse-center-hook, commandBoth ¬mouse-select and ¬mouse-to-tag run the appropriate
hook function for the mouse button that invoked them, whenever you
use the mouse to select text or position point.  The hook functions
for the other two mouse buttons are named mouse-right-hook
and mouse-center-hook.  You can redefine these hooks to make
the mouse buttons do additional things after you select text, without
having to write new commands using the extension language.  (Note
that in Epsilon for Windows mouse-to-tag displays a context
menu instead of selecting text, by calling the context-menu
command, and doesn't call any hook function.)

By default, the center mouse button runs the command
¬mouse-center, which calls either ¬mouse-yank to make the
mouse yank text from the clipboard under Unix, or ¬mouse-pan, so
that button makes the mouse scroll or pan (in other environments).

2Miscellaneous

Rkey-repeat-rateRnarrowingEpsilon for Windows 95/98/NT includes an ¬eval command that quickly
evaluates an arbitrary EEL expression.  Similarly, the
¬execute-eel command executes a line of EEL code that you type
in.

The command ¬narrow-to-region temporarily
restricts your access to the current buffer to the region between the
current values of point and mark.  Epsilon hides the portion of the
buffer outside this region.  Searches will only operate in the
narrowed region.  While running with the buffer narrowed, Epsilon
considers the buffer to start at the beginning of the region, and end
at the end of the region.  However, if you use a file-saving command
with the buffer narrowed in this manner, Epsilon will write the
entire file to disk.  To restore normal access to the buffer, use the
¬widen-buffer command.

Under DOS and Windows, you can set Epsilon's
key repeat rate with the ¬key-repeat-rate≈key-repeat-rate variable.  It
contains the number of repeats to perform in each second.  Setting
this variable to 0 lets the keyboard determine the repeat rate, as it
does outside of Epsilon.  Epsilon never lets repeated keys pile up;
it ignores automatically repeated keys when necessary.

In the next chapter, we list all of Epsilon's commands alphabetically.

1Command Reference

”CedocThis chapter lists all of Epsilon's commands in alphabetical order.

2abort

 Cabortabort–l rAbort the currently executing command.Ctrl-G—

This special command causes a currently executing command to stop, if
possible.  It cancels any executing macros, and discards any
characters you may have typed that Epsilon hasn't read.  Under DOS,
the ⁄Scroll Lock€ key also aborts, while under OS/2, the
Control-⁄Scroll Lock€ key serves the same purpose.  Use the
set-abort-key command to change the abort key.

“abort

 Cabout-epsilonabout-epsilonShow Epsilon's version number and operating system.

“about-epsilon

2alt-prefix

 Calt-prefixalt-prefix–l rInterpret the next key as an Alt key.ESC—

This command reads a character from the keyboard, then runs the
command bound to the Alt version of that key.

“alt-prefix

2ansi-to-oem

 Cansi-to-oemansi-to-oemConvert buffer's Windows character set to DOS.

Windows programs typically use a different character set than do DOS
programs.  The DOS character set is known as the DOS/OEM character
set, and includes various line drawing characters and miscellaneous
characters not in the Windows/ANSI set.  The Windows/ANSI character
set includes many accented characters not in the DOS/OEM character
set.  Epsilon for Windows uses the Windows/ANSI character set (with
most fonts).

The ansi-to-oem command converts the current buffer from the
Windows/ANSI character set to the DOS/OEM character set.  If any
character in the buffer doesn't have a unique translation, the
command warns first, and moves to the first character without a
unique translation.

This command ignores any narrowing established by the
narrow-to-region command.  It's only available in Epsilon for
Windows.

“ansi-to-oem

2append-next-kill

 Cappend-next-killappend-next-kill–l rDon't discard a kill buffer.Ctrl-Alt-W—

Normally, kill commands select a new kill buffer before inserting
their own text there, unless immediately preceded by another kill
command.  This command causes an immediately following kill command
to append to the current kill buffer.  However, if the current region
is rectangular, this command instead deletes it by invoking
delete-rectangle.

“append-next-kill

2apropos

 CaproposaproposList commands pertaining to a topic.

This command asks for a string, then displays a list of commands and
variables and their one-line descriptions that contain the string.
You can get more information on any of these by following the links:
double-click or use ⁄Tab€ and ⁄Enter€.

“apropos

2argument

 Cargumentargument–l rSet the numeric argument or multiply it by four.Ctrl-U—

Followed by digits (or the Alt versions of digits), this command
uses them to specify the numeric argument for the next command.  If
not followed by digits, this command sets the numeric argument to
four, or multiplies an existing numeric argument by four.  If bound
to a digit or Alt digit, argument acts as if you typed that digit
after invoking it.

Most commands use a numeric argument as a repeat count.  For example,
Ctrl-U 7 Alt-F moves forward seven words, and Ctrl-U Ctrl-U Ctrl-F
moves forward sixteen (four times four) characters.

Some other commands interpret the numeric argument in their own way.
See also auto-fill-mode, query-replace, and kill-line.

“argument

2asm-mode

 Casm-modeasm-modeSet up for editing Assembly Language files.

This command puts the current buffer in Asm mode, suitable for
assembly files.

“asm-mode

2auto-fill-mode

 Cauto-fill-modeauto-fill-modeToggle automatic line breaking.

Epsilon can automatically break lines when you type text.  With auto
filling enabled, Epsilon will break the line when necessary by
turning some previous space into a newline, breaking the line at that
point.  You can set the maximum line length for breaking purposes
with the set-fill-column command.

Use this command to enable or disable auto filling for the current
buffer.  A nonzero numeric argument turns auto filling on.  A numeric
argument of zero turns it off.  With no numeric argument, the command
toggles the state of auto filling.  In any case, the command reports
the new status of auto filling in the echo area.

To set auto-fill on by default in new buffers you create, use the
set-variable command on F8 to set the default value of the
fill-mode variable to 1.

In C mode buffers, this command simply sets the variable
c-auto-fill-mode.

“auto-fill-mode

2back-to-tab-stop

 Cback-to-tab-stopback-to-tab-stop–l rMove back to the previous tab stop.Shift-⁄Tab€—

This command moves point to the left until it reaches a tab stop, a
column that is a multiple of the tab size.

If a region is highlighted, Epsilon unindents the region by one tab
stop.  With a numeric prefix argument, Epsilon unindents by that
amount.

“back-to-tab-stop

2backward-character

 Cbackward-characterbackward-character–l rMove point back.Ctrl-B—

Point moves back one character.  Nothing happens if you run this
command with point at the beginning of the buffer.

“backward-character

2backward-delete-character

 Cbackward-delete-characterbackward-delete-character–l rDelete the character before point.Ctrl-H—

This command deletes the character before point.  When given a
numeric argument, the command deletes that many characters, and saves
them in a kill buffer.

“backward-delete-character

2backward-delete-word

 Cbackward-delete-wordbackward-delete-word–l rDelete the word before point.Brief: Ctrl-⁄Backspace€—

The command moves point as in backward-word, deleting the
characters it passes over.  See backward-kill-word for a similar
command that cuts the text to a kill buffer.

“backward-delete-word

2backward-ifdef

 Cbackward-ifdefbackward-ifdef–l rFind matching preprocessor line.C mode: Alt-[, Alt-⁄Up€—

This command moves to the previous #if/#else/#endif (or similar)
preprocessor line.  When starting from such a line, Epsilon finds the
previous matching one, skipping over inner nested preprocessor lines.

“backward-ifdef

2backward-kill-level

 Cbackward-kill-levelbackward-kill-level–l rKill a bracketed expression backwards.Alt-⁄Del€—

The command moves point as in backward-level, killing the
characters it passes over.

2backward-paragraph

 Cbackward-paragraphbackward-paragraph–l rGo back one paragraph.Alt-[—

Point travels backward through the buffer until positioned at the
beginning of a paragraph.  Lines that start with whitespace
(including blank lines) always separate paragraphs.  For information
on changing Epsilon's notion of a paragraph, see the
¬forward-paragraph command.

“backward-paragraph

2backward-sentence

 Cbackward-sentencebackward-sentence–l rGo back one sentence.Alt-A—

Point travels backwards through the buffer until positioned at the
beginning of a sentence.  A sentence ends with a period, exclamation
point, or question mark, followed by two spaces or a newline, with
any number of closing characters ", ', ), ], between.  A sentence
also ends at the end of a paragraph.  See forward-paragraph.

2bind-to-key

 Cbind-to-keybind-to-key–l rPut a named command on a key.F4—

This command prompts you for the name of a command, then for a key.
Thereafter, pressing that key runs that command.  This key binding
persists only until you exit Epsilon, unless you save the binding in
a command file or save Epsilon's entire state with the
write-state command.

“bind-to-key

2brief-copy-region

 Cbrief-copy-regionbrief-copy-region–l rCopy a highlighted region, saving it.Brief: Grey +—

This command saves a copy of the highlighted region to a kill buffer
so you can insert it somewhere else.  If no region is highlighted,
the command copies the current line.

“brief-copy-region

2brief-cut-region

 Cbrief-cut-regionbrief-cut-region–l rDelete a highlighted region, saving it.Brief: Grey -—

This command kills the highlighted region, saving a copy of the
region to a kill buffer so you can insert it somewhere else.  If no
region is highlighted, the command kills the current line.

“brief-cut-region

2brief-delete-region

 Cbrief-delete-regionbrief-delete-region–l rDelete a highlighted region without saving.Brief: ⁄Del€—

This command deletes the highlighted region without saving it in a
kill buffer.  If no region is highlighted, the command deletes the
next character in the buffer.

“brief-delete-region

2brief-delete-window

 Cbrief-delete-windowbrief-delete-window–l rRemove one of a window's borders.Brief: F4—

This command prompts you to indicate which of the current window's
borders you wish to delete.  Press an arrow key and Epsilon will
delete other windows as needed to remove that window border.

“brief-delete-window

2brief-drop-bookmark

 Cbrief-drop-bookmarkbrief-drop-bookmark–l rRemember this location.Brief: Alt-0 ... Alt-9—

This command remembers the current buffer and position, so that you
can easily return to it later with brief-jump-to-bookmark.
Normally, the command looks at the key you pressed to invoke it, to
determine which of the ten Brief bookmarks to set.  For example, if
you press Alt-3 to invoke it, it sets bookmark 3.  If you press Alt-0
to invoke it, it sets bookmark 10.  When you invoke the command by
pressing some other key, it prompts for the bookmark to set.

Brief bookmarks 1-10 are really synonyms for Epsilon bookmarks A-M.
You can use Epsilon commands like list-bookmarks to see all the
bookmarks and select one.

“brief-drop-bookmark

2brief-end-key

 Cbrief-end-keybrief-end-key–l rGo to the end of the line/window/buffer.Brief: ⁄End€—

This command goes to the end of the current line.  When you press it
twice in succession, it goes to the end of the current window.  When
you press it three times in succession, it goes to the end of the
current buffer.

“brief-end-key

2brief-home-key

 Cbrief-home-keybrief-home-key–l rGo to the start of the line/window/buffer.Brief: ⁄Home€—

This command goes to the start of the current line.  When you press
it twice in succession, it goes to the start of the current window.
When you press it three times in succession, it goes to the start of
the current buffer.

“brief-home-key

2brief-jump-to-bookmark

 Cbrief-jump-to-bookmarkbrief-jump-to-bookmark–l rJump to a bookmark.Brief: Alt-J—

This command returns to a bookmark previously set with
brief-drop-bookmark.  It prompts for the number of the bookmark
you wish to return to.

Brief bookmarks 1-10 are really synonyms for Epsilon bookmarks A-M.
You can use Epsilon commands like list-bookmarks to see all the
bookmarks and select one.

“brief-jump-to-bookmark

2brief-keyboard

 Cbrief-keyboardbrief-keyboardLoad the Brief-style keyboard layout.

This command redefines the keyboard to resemble the key arrangement
used by the Brief editor.  Use the command epsilon-keyboard to
return to Epsilon's default keyboard arrangement.

“brief-keyboard

2brief-open-line

 Cbrief-open-linebrief-open-line–l rMake a new line below this one.Brief: Ctrl-⁄Enter€—

This command adds a new line after the current one and moves to it.

“brief-open-line

2brief-resize-window

 Cbrief-resize-windowbrief-resize-window–l rMove the window's border.Brief: F2—

This command prompts you to indicate which of the current window's
borders you would like to move.  Press an arrow key to select one.
Then press arrow keys to move the window's border around.  Press
⁄Enter€ when you are satisfied with the window's size.  Epsilon will
resize other windows as necessary.

“brief-resize-window

2brief-split-window

 Cbrief-split-windowbrief-split-window–l rPut a new border inside this window.Brief: F3—

This command prompts you to indicate where you would like to create a
new window border.  Press an arrow key and Epsilon will split off a
new window from the current one, with the border between the two in
the indicated direction.

“brief-split-window

2bufed

 Cbufedbufed–l rManipulate a list of buffers.Ctrl-X Ctrl-B—

This command makes a list of buffers, puts the list in the bufed
buffer, and lets you edit it.  Alphabetic keys run special bufed
commands.  The N and P commands go to the next and previous buffers
in the list, respectively.  The D command deletes the buffer on the
current line immediately.  It warns you if the buffer has unsaved
changes.  The ⁄Space€ or E key selects the buffer on the current
line, and the S key writes the buffer named on the current line to
its file.  Typing 1 makes the window occupy the whole screen, then
selects the buffer like E.  Typing 2 or 5 splits the window
horizontally or vertically, then selects the indicated buffer.
Shift-P prints the buffer on the current line.

In a bufed listing, the A, B, F, and I keys make bufed sort the
buffer list by last access time, buffer name, file name, or size,
respectively.  Use the shifted versions of these keys to sort in
reverse.  Pressing U requests an unsorted buffer list: the newest
buffers appear first in the list.

This command does not normally list special buffers such as the kill
buffers whose names begin with the "-" character.  To list even
these buffers, give the bufed command (or a sorting command) a
numeric argument.

“c-hash-mark

2c-mode

 Cc-modec-modeDo automatic indentation for C-like languages.

This command puts the current buffer in C mode, appropriate for
editing programs written in any language with a syntax similar to C
(such as EEL).  In C mode, ⁄Enter€ indents each new line by scanning
previous lines to determine the proper indentation.  ⁄Tab€ reindents
the current line when you invoke it with point inside a line's
indentation.  With point outside a line's indentation, or when
repeated, this command adds more indentation.

By default, the find-file command automatically turns on C mode
for files that end with .c, .cpp, .hpp, .cxx, .hxx, .y, .h. or .e.

“c-mode

2capitalize-word

 Ccapitalize-wordcapitalize-word–l rUpper case beginning character.Alt-C—

Point travels forward through the buffer as with forward-word.
Each time it encounters a run of alpha characters, it converts the
first character to upper case, and the remainder to lower case.

For example, if you execute this command with point positioned just
before "wORd", it becomes "Word".  Similarly, "wORd_wORd"
becomes "Word_Word".

If the current buffer contains a highlighted region, Epsilon instead
capitalizes all the words in the region, leaving point unchanged.

“capitalize-word

2case-indirect

 Ccase-indirectcase-indirectDo the reverse-case binding of the invoking key.

Upper case Alt keys and upper case Control-X keys normally run this
command.  The command invokes the alternate case version of the key
that invoked it.  If you happen to type Ctrl-x E (which runs the
command case-indirect) instead of Ctrl-x e (which runs
last-kbd-macro), the case-indirect command would invoke
last-kbd-macro for you.

“case-indirect

2cd

 Ccdcd–l rChange the current directory.F7—

The cd command prompts for the name of a directory, then sets
Epsilon's current directory.  If you press Alt-E when prompted for
the directory name, Epsilon will type in the name of the directory
portion of the current file name.

When Epsilon displays a file name (for example, in a buffer's mode
line), it usually describes the file relative to this current
directory.

Epsilon uses its notion of the current directory when it prompts for
a file name and the current buffer has no specific directory
associated with it.  (This typically happens when the buffer has no
associated file name.)

Also, if you remove any pre-typed directory name and type a relative
pathname to such a command, Epsilon will interpret what you type
relative to the directory set by the cd command.

See the prompt-with-buffer-directory variable for more
information.

“cd

2center-line

 Ccenter-linecenter-line–l rCenter line horizontally.Alt-S—

This command centers the current line between the first column and
the right margin, by changing the line's indentation if necessary.
You can set the right margin with the set-fill-column command.

“center-line

2center-window

 Ccenter-windowcenter-window–l rVertically center the current window.Ctrl-L—

This command makes the line containing point appear in the center of
the window.  With a numeric argument »n…, it makes the line appear on
line »n… of the window.  Line 0 refers to the top line.

“center-window

2change-code-coloring

 Cchange-code-coloringchange-code-coloringToggle code coloring on or off in this buffer.

This command toggles between coloring and not coloring the program
text in the current buffer by setting the want-code-coloring
variable.  The command has no effect in buffers Epsilon doesn't know
how to color.

“change-code-coloring

2change-file-read-only

 Cchange-file-read-onlychange-file-read-onlyChange the read-only status of a file.

This command prompts for a file name (default: the current file) and
toggles its read-only attribute.  Under Unix, it either makes the
file unwritable to all, or writable to all (to the extent permitted
by the current umask).  Use Alt-o ! chmod for finer control.

“change-file-read-only

2change-font-size

 Cchange-font-sizechange-font-sizeSet the font's width and height.

This command supplements the set-font command by providing
additional font choices.  Some Windows fonts include a variety of
character cell widths for a given character cell height.  (For
example, many of the font selections available in windowed DOS
sessions use multiple widths.)  Commands like set-font utilize
the standard Windows font dialog, which doesn't provide any way to
select these alternate widths.  This command lets you choose these
fonts.

The change-font-size command doesn't change the font name, or
toggle bold or italic.  You'll need to use the set-font command
to do that.

Instead, change-font-size lets you adjust the height and width of
the current font using the arrow keys.  You can abort to restore the
old font settings, or press ⁄Enter€ or ⁄Space€ to keep them.  This is
a handy way to shrink or expand the font size.  A width or height of
0 means use a suitable default.

“change-font-size

2change-line-wrapping

 Cchange-line-wrappingchange-line-wrappingChange whether this window wraps or scrolls long lines.

This command toggles whether the current window displays long lines
by wrapping them onto succeeding screen lines, rather than truncating
them at the right edge of the screen.  With a negative numeric
argument, it forces wrapping.  With a non-negative argument, it
forces truncation, and tries to set the display column to the value
of the numeric argument.

“change-line-wrapping

2change-modified

 Cchange-modifiedchange-modified–l rChange the modified status of the buffer.Alt-~—

This command causes Epsilon to change its opinion as to the modified
status of the buffer.  Epsilon uses this modified status to warn you
of unsaved buffers when you exit.  Epsilon indicates modified buffers
by displaying a star at the end of the mode line.

“change-modified

2change-name

 Cchange-namechange-nameRename a variable or command.

You can change the name of a command, keyboard macro, or EEL variable
with this command.

“change-name

2change-read-only

 Cchange-read-onlychange-read-onlyChange the read-only status of the buffer.

This command changes the read-only status of the buffer.  Attempting
to modify a read-only buffer results in an error message.  If a
window contains a read-only buffer, the modeline contains the letters
"RO".  With no numeric argument, the command toggles the read-only
status of the buffer.  With a non-zero numeric argument, the buffer
becomes read-only; otherwise, the buffer becomes changeable.

“change-read-only

2change-show-spaces

 Cchange-show-spaceschange-show-spaces–l rToggle whether or not Epsilon makes whitespace visible.Shift-F6—

Epsilon can display the nonprinting characters space, tab, or newline
using special graphic characters to indicate the position of each
character in the buffer.  This command switches between displaying
markers for these characters and making them invisible, by setting
the current value of the buffer-specific variable
¬show-spaces≈show-spaces.

“clear-tags

2compare-sorted-windows

 Ccompare-sorted-windowscompare-sorted-windowsFind lines missing from the current or next windows.

This command copies all lines that appear in both the current
window's buffer, and the next window's buffer, into a buffer named
"inboth".  It copies other lines to buffers named "only1" and
"only2".  It assumes that you already sorted the original buffers.

“compare-sorted-windows

2compare-windows

 Ccompare-windowscompare-windows–l rFind the next difference between the current and next windows.Ctrl-F2—

This command moves forward from point in the buffers displayed in the
current window and the next window.  It compares the text in the
buffers, stopping when it finds a difference or reaches the end of a
buffer, then reports the result.

If repeated, it alternates between finding the next difference and
finding the next match (by resynchronizing the buffers).

“compare-windows

2compile-buffer

 Ccompile-bufferRcompile-buffercompile-buffer–l rCompile the current buffer as appropriate.Alt-F3—

This command tries to compile the current buffer.
It uses the compiling command appropriate for the current buffer.
For .c files, this is contained in the compile-c-cmd variable.
For .cpp or .cxx files, this is contained in the compile-cpp-cmd
variable.  For .e files, this is contained in the compile-eel-cmd
variable.  When you compile an EEL file successfully, Epsilon
automatically loads the resulting bytecode file.

If the current buffer has no compilation command associated with it,
Epsilon will prompt for the appropriate command and record it in the
buffer-specific variable compile-buffer-cmd.  For C, C++, and EEL
files, Epsilon automatically sets this to refer to the variables
listed above.

pre_compile_hookpost_compile_hook Ppre_compile_hook,
subroutine Ppost_compile_hook,
subroutineBefore and after running the compilation command, Epsilon does any
mode-specific operations needed, by calling the buffer-specific
function pointer variables
pre_compile_hook and
post_compile_hook, respectively.  An EEL programmer can use these hooks to
make Epsilon perform additional actions each time you compile
buffers.  Epsilon uses the post_compile_hook to automatically
load an EEL file after it's been successfully compiled.

do_compile() Pdo_compile(), subroutineThe function pointed to by post_compile_hook receives one
parameter, a status code returned by the do_compile(
) subroutine.  See that
function's definition in proc.e for details.  The function pointed to
by pre_compile_hook receives no parameters.  If either
variable holds a null pointer, Epsilon doesn't call it.

This command displays a context menu in Epsilon for Windows.  The
right mouse button runs this command.

“context-menu

2copy-rectangle

 Ccopy-rectanglecopy-rectangleCopy the current rectangle to a kill buffer.

This command copies the rectangular block between point and mark to a
kill buffer, without changing the current buffer.  (Actually, the
command may insert spaces at the ends of lines, or convert tabs to
spaces, if that's necessary to reach the starting or ending column on
one of the lines in the region.  But the buffer won't look any
different as a result of these changes.)

“copy-rectangle

2copy-region

 Ccopy-regioncopy-region–l rCopy the region to a temporary buffer.Alt-W—

This command copies the region of the buffer between point and mark
to a kill buffer, without changing the current buffer.

“copy-region

2copy-to-clipboard

 Ccopy-to-clipboardcopy-to-clipboardCopy the current region to the clipboard.

When running under MS-Windows or as an X program in Unix, this
command copies the current region onto the clipboard so other
applications can access it.  Under DOS, the region must have fewer
than 65,500 characters.

“copy-to-clipboard

2copy-to-file

 Ccopy-to-filecopy-to-file–l rCopy buffer contents to a file.Ctrl-F7—

This command prompts you for a file name, then writes the buffer to
that file.  The file associated with the current buffer remains the
same.  See also write-file.

“copy-to-file

2copy-to-scratch

 Ccopy-to-scratchcopy-to-scratch–l rCopy the region to a permanent buffer.Ctrl-X X—

This command copies the text in the region between point and mark.
It asks for a letter (or number), then associates that character with
the text.  Subsequently, you can insert the text by invoking the
insert-scratch command.  See also the commands kill-region
and copy-region.

“copy-to-scratch

2count-lines

 Ccount-linescount-lines–l rShow the number of lines in the buffer.Ctrl-X L—

A message showing the number of lines in the buffer appears in the

line, and the length of the file when written to disk.  If there is a
highlighted region, its line count is displayed as well.

“count-lines

2create-file-associations

 Ccreate-file-associationscreate-file-associationsMake Windows run Epsilon to launch certain file types.

You can set up Windows file associations for Epsilon using the
create-file-associations command.  It lets you modify a list of
common extensions, then sets up Windows to invoke Epsilon to edit
files with those extensions.  The files will be sent to an existing
copy of Epsilon, if one is running.  If not, a new instance of
Epsilon will be started.

The command dired (for directory edit) allows you to conveniently
peruse the contents of a directory, examining the contents of files
and, if you wish, selecting some for deletion, copying, or moving.

The command prompts for the name of a directory or a file pattern.
By default, it uses the current directory.  It then displays a buffer
in the current window, with contents similar to what the operating
system command "dir" would display.  Each line of the dired buffer
contains the name of a file and information about it.

In dired mode, alphabetic keys run special dired commands.  See the
description of the dired-mode command for details.  Typing H or
"?" in dired mode gives help on dired subcommands.

2dired-mode

 Cdired-modedired-modeEdit a directory of file names.

A dired (directory edit) buffer lists the contents of a directory.
In a dired buffer, you can use these keys: ŒN moves to the next entry in the list.

ŒP moves to the previous entry.

ŒD flags a file (or empty directory) that you wish to delete by
placing a "D" before its name.

ŒC marks a file for copying.

ŒM marks a file for moving (renaming).

ŒU removes any flags from the file listed on the current line.

ŒX actually deletes, copies, or moves the files.  Epsilon will ask
for the destination directory into which the files are to be copied
or moved, if any files are so marked.  If there is only one file to
copy or move, you can also specify a file name destination, so you
can use the command for renaming files.  Epsilon prompts for a single
destination for all files to be copied, and another for all files to
be moved.  If any files are marked for deletion, Epsilon will ask you
to confirm that you want to delete the files.

ŒE or ⁄Space€ or ⁄Enter€ lets you examine the contents of a file.
It invokes the find-file command on the file, making the current
window display this file instead of the dired buffer.  After
examining a file, you can use the select-buffer command (Ctrl-X
B) to return to the dired buffer.  Press ⁄Enter€ when prompted for
the buffer name and the previous buffer shown in the current window
will reappear (in this case, the dired buffer).  Applied to a
directory, the E command does a dired of that directory.

ŒV runs the "viewer" for that file; the program assigned to it
according to Windows file association.  For executable files, it runs
the program.  For document files, it typically runs the Windows
program assigned to that file extension.  (Epsilon for Windows only.)

ŒT displays the MS-Windows properties dialog for that file or
directory.  For a directory, this lets you view the size of its
contents.

ŒR refreshes the current listing.  Epsilon will use the original
file pattern to rebuild the file listing.  If you've marked files for
copying, moving, or deleting, the markings will be discarded if you
refresh the listing, so Epsilon will prompt first to confirm that you
want to do this.

ŒS controls sorting.  It prompts you to enter another letter to
change the sorting method.  Type "?" at that prompt to see the
sorting options available.

Œ+ creates a subdirectory.  It asks for the new subdirectory's name.

Œ. or ^ invokes a dired on the parent directory of the current
dired.

Œ1 makes the window occupy the whole screen, then acts like E.

Œ2 or 5 splits the window horizontally or vertically, then acts
like E in the new window.

ŒO switches to the next window, then acts like E.

ŒZ zooms the current window like the zoom-window command, then
acts like E.

Œ! prompts for a command line, then runs the specified program,
adding the name of the current line's file after it.

ŒShift-U or Shift-L marks a file for uppercasing or lowercasing its
file name, respectively.  Press X to rename the marked files, as with
other renaming keys.  (Note that Epsilon for Windows displays
all-uppercase file names in lowercase by default, so Shift-U's effect
may not be visible within Epsilon.  See preserve-filename-case.)

ŒShift-R marks a file for a regular-expression replacement on its
name.  When you press X to execute operations on marked files,
Epsilon will ask for a pattern and replacement text.  Then for each
marked file, it will perform the indicated replacement on its name to
create a new file name, then rename the file to the new name.  For
instance, to rename a group of files like dir¥file1.cxx,
dir¥file2.cxx, etc. to dir2¥file1.cpp, dir2¥file2.cpp, use Shift-R
and specify dir¥(.*).cxx as the search text and dir2¥#1.cpp
as the replacement text.  To rename some .htm files to .html, specify
.* as the search text and #0l as the replacement text.

ŒH or ? gives this help.

“dired-mode

2dired-sort

 Cdired-sortdired-sort–l rSort a directory listing differently.Dired mode: S—

In a dired buffer, this subcommand controls sorting.  It prompts you
to enter another letter to change the sorting method.  Press N,
E, S, or D to select sorting by file name, file
extension, size, or time and date of modification, respectively.
Press U to turn off sorting the next time Epsilon makes a dired
listing, and display the file names in the same order they come from
the operating system.  (You can have Epsilon rebuild the current
listing using the R dired subcommand.)

Press + or - at the sorting prompt to sort in ascending or
descending order, respectively, or R to reverse the current
sorting order.  Press ⁄Enter€ to sort again using the currently
selected sorting order.

Press G at the sorting prompt to toggle directory grouping.  With
directory grouping, Epsilon puts all subdirectories first in the
list, then all files, and sorts each part individually.  Without
directory grouping, it mixes the two together (although it still puts
. and .. first).

“dired-sort

2display-buffer-info

 Cdisplay-buffer-infodisplay-buffer-info–l rDisplay the name of the current file.Brief: Alt-F—

This command displays the name of the file associated with the
current buffer, and the mode of the current buffer.  It displays an
asterisk after the file name if the file has unsaved changes.  This
command can be useful if you've set Epsilon so it doesn't display
these things continuously.

“display-buffer-info

2do-c-indent

 Cdo-c-indentdo-c-indent–l rIndent this line for C.C mode: ⁄Tab€—

In a line's indentation, reindent the line correctly for C code.
Inside the text of a line, or when repeated, insert a tab.

If a region is highlighted, Epsilon indents all lines in the region
by one tab stop.  With a numeric prefix argument, Epsilon indents by
that amount.

“do-c-indent

2down-line

 Cdown-linedown-line–l rMove point to the next line.Ctrl-N—

This command keeps point near the same horizontal position as it
occupied on the previous line, if possible.

“down-line

2edit-variables

 Cedit-variablesedit-variables–l rInteractively set variables from a list.Alt-F8—

This command displays a list of all variables and lets you set them.
You can use the arrow keys or the normal movement keys to move around
the list, or begin typing a variable name to have Epsilon jump to
that portion of the list.  Press ⁄Enter€ to set the highlighted
variable, then edit the value shown using normal Epsilon commands.

To exit from edit-variables, press ⁄Esc€ or Ctrl-G.

With a numeric argument, the command includes system variables in its
list.

In Epsilon for Windows, this command displays a list of variables.
You can choose one, see its description and its current value, and
modify it.  The command will only list those variables included in
the help file.

“edit-variables

2end-kbd-macro

 Cend-kbd-macroend-kbd-macro–l rStop defining a keyboard macro.Ctrl-X )—

This command completes the keyboard macro started by the
start-kbd-macro command.  You may then execute the macro with the
command last-kbd-macro, or you may give the macro a name with the
command name-kbd-macro.

“end-kbd-macro

2end-of-line

 Cend-of-lineend-of-line–l rGo to the end of the line.Ctrl-E—

This command positions point at the end of the current line, just
before the newline character.

“end-of-line

2end-of-window

 Cend-of-windowend-of-window–l rGo to last character in window.Alt-.—

Position point before the last character in the current window.

“end-of-window

2enlarge-window

 Cenlarge-windowenlarge-window–l rEnlarge window by one line.Ctrl-⁄PgUp€—

If possible, the mode line of the window on top of the current window
moves up.  Otherwise, the current window's mode line moves down.
This command has no effect if it would make any window smaller than
two lines, counting the mode line.

“enlarge-window

2enlarge-window-horizontally

 Cenlarge-window-horizontallyenlarge-window-horizontally–l rEnlarge window by one column.Alt-⁄PgDn€—

If possible, the left boundary of the current window moves to the
left by one character.  Otherwise, the current window's right
boundary moves to the right.  This command has no effect if it would
make any window smaller than one character wide.

“enlarge-window-horizontally

2enlarge-window-interactively

 Cenlarge-window-interactivelyenlarge-window-interactively–l rUse arrow keys to resize a window.Ctrl-X +—

This command lets you interactively change the size of the current
window.  After you invoke the command, use the arrow keys to point to
a window border.  The indicated border moves in a direction so as to
make the current window larger.  Keep pressing arrow keys to move
window borders.  To switch from enlarging to shrinking, press the
minus key.  Thereafter, the arrow keys cause the window border to
move in a direction so as to shrink the window.  When the window
looks right, press ⁄Enter€ to leave the command.

“enlarge-window-interactively

2enter-key

 Center-keyenter-key–l rInsert a newline character.Ctrl-M—

This command acts like normal-character but inserts a newline
character regardless of the key that invoked it.  In overwrite mode,
the ⁄Enter€ key simply moves to the beginning of the next line.

“enter-key

2epsilon-html-look-up

 Cepsilon-html-look-upepsilon-html-look-up–l rLook up a topic in the HTML Epsilon manual.F1 h—

This command prompts for a topic, then displays a section of the
Epsilon manual that refers to that topic, using a web browser.

“epsilon-html-look-up

2epsilon-info-look-up

 Cepsilon-info-look-upepsilon-info-look-up–l rLook up a topic in the Epsilon manual.F1 f—

This command prompts for a topic, then displays a section of the
Epsilon manual that refers to that topic, using Info mode.  It's like
using the epsilon-manual-info command followed by the
info-index command.  In EEL source code, the identifier at point
becomes the default topic.

“epsilon-info-look-up

2epsilon-keyboard

 Cepsilon-keyboardepsilon-keyboardLoad a default keyboard, undoing keyboard changes.

This command restores Epsilon's original keyboard arrangement after
running the brief-keyboard or cua-keyboard commands, which
see.  It restores a "canned" keyboard arrangement from the file
epsilon.kbd, which must be on the path.

“epsilon-keyboard

2epsilon-manual-html

 Cepsilon-manual-htmlepsilon-manual-htmlDisplay the HTML-format version of the Epsilon manual.

This command displays the Epsilon manual's table of contents using a
web browser.

“epsilon-manual-html

2epsilon-manual-info

 Cepsilon-manual-infoepsilon-manual-infoDisplay the Info-format version of the Epsilon manual.

This command enters Info mode and jumps to the top node of Epsilon's
manual.

“epsilon-manual-info

2epsilon-manual

 Cepsilon-manualepsilon-manualDisplay Epsilon's manual.

This command makes Epsilon for Windows display its on-line manual in
WinHelp.  If you highlight a keyword first, Epsilon will look for
help on the highlighted text.  Otherwise, Epsilon will display the
manual's table of contents.  Also see epsilon-manual-info.

“epsilon-manual

2eval

 CevalevalCompute and display the value of an expression.

This command prompts for an expression, then computes and displays
its value using the integrated EEL compiler in Epsilon for Windows
95/98/NT.  The expression may have a numeric or string type.  Also
see the ¬execute-eel command.

“eval

2exchange-point-and-mark

 Cexchange-point-and-markexchange-point-and-mark–l rSwap point and mark.Ctrl-X Ctrl-X—

Some commands such as kill-region and copy-region operate on
the text between the point and the mark.

“exchange-point-and-mark

2execute-eel

 Cexecute-eelexecute-eelExecute a line of EEL code.

This command prompts for an EEL statement, then executes it using the
integrated EEL compiler in Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT.  Also see
the ¬eval command.

“execute-eel

2exit

 Cexitexit–l rExit the editor.Ctrl-X Ctrl-C—

If you haven't saved all your files, Epsilon will display a list
using ¬bufed and ask if you really want to exit.  If you prefix
this command with a numeric argument, however, Epsilon will simply
exit and not ask you about any unsaved buffers.

“exit

2exit-level

 Cexit-levelexit-level–l rExit the current recursive edit.Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z—

If you have entered a recursive edit (typically from
query-replace), this command exits the recursive edit (bringing
you back to the replace), otherwise it invokes exit.

“exit-level

2exit-process

 Cexit-processexit-processType "exit" to the concurrent process.

This command tries to make the currently executing concurrent process
stop, by typing "exit" to it.  A standard command processor exits
when it receives this command.

“exit-process

2export-colors

 Cexport-colorsexport-colorsSave color settings to an EEL source file.

The export-colors command constructs an EEL source file of color
settings based on the current color settings.  Use it to transfer
color changes to a different version of Epsilon, or to get a
human-readable version of your color selections.

“export-colors

2file-query-replace

 Cfile-query-replacefile-query-replace–l rReplace text in many files.Shift-F7—

This command prompts for the text to search for and the replacement
text.  Then it prompts for a file name which may contain wildcards.
The command then performs a query-replace on each file that
matches the pattern, going to each occurrence of the search text, and
asking whether or not to replace it.

With a numeric argument, the command instead cycles through all
buffers.  The buffer name pattern must be a simple prefix if you use
it, like "a" to search all buffers whose names start with "a"; no
wildcards are permitted.

At each occurrence of the search text, you have these choices:
ŒY or ⁄Space€ replaces and goes to the next match.

ŒN or ⁄Backspace€ doesn't replace, but goes to the next match.

Œ⁄Esc€ exits immediately.

Œ. replaces and then exits.

Œ^ backs up to the previous match, as long as it's within the same
file.

Œ! replaces all remaining occurrences in the current file without
prompting, then asks if you want to replace all occurrences without
prompting in all remaining files.

Œ, replaces the current match but doesn't go to the next match.

ŒCtrl-R enters a recursive edit, allowing you to modify the buffer
arbitrarily.  When you exit the recursive edit with exit-level, the
query-replace continues.

ŒCtrl-G exits and returns point to its original location in the
current buffer, then asks if you want to look for possible
replacements in the remaining files.

ŒCtrl-W toggles the state of word mode.

ŒCtrl-T toggles the state of regular expression mode (see the
description of regex-replace).

ŒCtrl-C toggles the state of case-folding.

ŒAny other key causes ¬query-replace to exit and any command
bound to that key to execute.

“file-query-replace

2fill-c-comment

 Cfill-c-commentfill-c-comment–l rReformat the current paragraph in a comment.C mode: Alt-q—

This command fills the current paragraph in a C/C++/Java comment, so
that each line but the last becomes as long as possible without going
past the fill column.  It tries to preserve any prefix before each
line.

“fill-c-comment

2fill-paragraph

 Cfill-paragraphfill-paragraph–l rFill the current paragraph.Alt-Q—

This command fills the current paragraph, so that each line but the
last becomes as long as possible without going past the fill column.
This command does not right-justify the paragraph with respect to the
fill column.

With a numeric argument greater than 5, the paragraph is filled using
that value as a temporary right margin.  With a smaller numeric
argument, the paragraph is filled using an infinite right margin, so
all text goes on one long line.

“fill-paragraph

2fill-region

 Cfill-regionfill-regionFill the current region between point and mark.

This command fills each paragraph in the region between point and
mark as in fill-paragraph.  For this command, only completely
empty lines separate one paragraph from another.

With a numeric argument greater than 5, the paragraph is filled using
that value as a temporary right margin.  With a smaller numeric
argument, the paragraph is filled using an infinite right margin, so
all text goes on one long line.

“fill-region

2filter-region

 Cfilter-regionfilter-region–l rSend the current region through an external program.Alt-|—

This command prompts for the name of a program and runs it, passing
the current region to it as its standard input.  It then displays any
output from the program in a separate buffer.  With a prefix
argument, it replaces the current region with the program's output.
This command is only available under Unix and in Epsilon for Windows
95/98/NT.

“filter-region

2find-delimiter

 Cfind-delimiterfind-delimiter–l rShow the matching left delimiter.Alt-)—

This command shows the left parenthesis, square bracket, or brace in
a balanced expression.  It invokes backward-level, displays this
location, pauses, and then returns point to its original location.
Note that the cursor must appear after a right delimiter, not on it,
to show the match for that delimiter.

You may change the length of time that this command pauses at the
left delimiter by setting the variables ¬near-pause≈near-pause
and ¬far-pause≈far-pause.  The former specifies how long to pause
(in hundredths of a second) if the left delimiter appeared in the
window originally.  The latter specifies how long to pause otherwise.

Regardless of the length of the pause, the pausing stops when you
press a key.

“find-delimiter

2find-file

 Cfind-filefind-file–l rPut a file in the current window.Ctrl-X Ctrl-F—

You would normally use this command to specify a file to edit.  This
command prompts you for a file name, then scans the buffers to see if
any of them contain that file.  If so, the command displays that
buffer in the current window.

Otherwise, the command creates a buffer with the same name as the
file, possibly modified to make it different from the names of
nonempty buffers, then reads the file into this buffer, then displays
that buffer in the current window.  With a numeric argument, the
command reads the file in untranslated mode and sets the buffer to
this mode (see set-line-translate).

If you simply type ⁄Enter€ for a file name, the command invokes
¬dired with the current directory for the file pattern.  Similarly,
if you specify a directory or a file name with wild card characters,
the command invokes ¬dired with that pattern.

See the descriptions of the prompt-with-buffer-directory and
want-common-file-dialog variables for more information on this
command.

“find-file

2find-linked-file

 Cfind-linked-filefind-linked-file–l rGrab the file name on this line and edit it.Ctrl-X Ctrl-L—

Look on the current line for a file name, and edit that file like the
find-file command.  Epsilon uses special rules for certain modes.
For HTML mode it looks for "<a href=...>" links.  For C/C++/Java
mode it follows #include references via the
¬include-directories≈include-directories variable.  In Java files
it understands the package and import keywords, and looks
along the CLASSPATH for packages.  For files with a .lst extension,
it assumes the current line holds a file name, instead of searching
for a pattern that matches a typical file name.  You can highlight a
file name first if Epsilon has trouble picking it out.

“find-linked-file

2find-oem-file

 Cfind-oem-filefind-oem-fileRead a file that uses the DOS character set.

Windows programs typically use a different character set than do DOS
programs.  The DOS character set is known as the DOS/OEM character
set, and includes various line drawing characters and miscellaneous
characters not in the Windows/ANSI set.  The Windows/ANSI character
set includes many accented characters not in the DOS/OEM character
set.  Epsilon for Windows uses the Windows/ANSI character set (with
most fonts).

The find-oem-file command reads a file using the DOS/OEM character
set, translating it into the Windows/ANSI character set, and arranges
things so when you save the file, the reverse translation
automatically occurs.  This command is only available in Epsilon for
Windows.  See the default-character-set variable.

“find-oem-file

2find-read-only-file

 Cfind-read-only-filefind-read-only-fileEdit a file preventing changes to it.

Prompt for a file name and edit the specified file, like the
find-file command.  Set the buffer read-only, and mark it so
attempts to save the file prompt for a different name.

“find-read-only-file

2find-unconverted-file

 Cfind-unconverted-filefind-unconverted-fileRead a file without changing its character set.

If you've configured Epsilon for Windows to convert from the DOS/OEM
character set to the ANSI character set upon reading a file, and to
perform the opposite conversion when writing (by setting the
default-character-set variable), use this command to bypass the
conversion for a particular file.

“find-unconverted-file

2finger

 CfingerfingerShow info on a user of a computer.

The finger command prompts for a string like "user@host.com",
then uses the finger protocol to query the specified computer on the
Internet for information about the given user.  You may omit the user
name to get a list of users logged onto the machine.  Not all
computers support this protocol.  The output appears in an
appropriately named buffer.

“finger

2forward-character

 Cforward-characterforward-character–l rGo forward one character.Ctrl-F—

Nothing happens if you run this command with point at the end of the
buffer.

“forward-character

2forward-ifdef

 Cforward-ifdefforward-ifdef–l rFind matching preprocessor line.C mode: Alt-], Alt-⁄Down€—

This command moves to the next #if/#else/#endif (or similar)
preprocessor line.  When starting from such a line, Epsilon finds the
next matching one, skipping over inner nested preprocessor lines.

“forward-ifdef

2forward-level

 Cforward-levelforward-level–l rMove point past a bracketed expression.Ctrl-Alt-F—

Point moves forward searching for one of (, {, or [.  Then point
moves past the nested expression.  Point appears after the
corresponding right delimiter.

“forward-level

2forward-paragraph

 Cforward-paragraphforward-paragraph–l rGo to the next paragraph.Alt-]—

Point travels forward through the buffer until it appears at the
beginning of a paragraph.  Blank lines (containing only spaces and
tabs) always separate paragraphs.

You can control what Epsilon considers a paragraph using two
variables.

If the buffer-specific variable
¬indents-separate-paragraphs≈indents-separate-paragraphs has a
nonzero value, then a paragraph also begins with a nonblank line that
starts with a tab or a space.

If the buffer-specific variable ¬tex-paragraphs≈tex-paragraphs
has a nonzero value, then Epsilon will not consider as part of a
paragraph any sequence of lines that each start with at sign or
period, if that sequence appears next to a blank line.  And lines
starting with ¥begin or ¥end or % will also delimit paragraphs.

“forward-paragraph

2forward-search-again

 Cforward-search-againforward-search-againSearch forward for the same search string.

“forward-search-again

2forward-sentence

 Cforward-sentenceforward-sentence–l rGo to the end of the sentence.Alt-E—

Point travels forward through the buffer until positioned at the end
of a sentence.  A sentence ends with a period, exclamation point, or
question mark, followed by two spaces or a newline, with any number
of closing characters ", ', ), ], between.  A sentence also ends
at the end of a paragraph.

“forward-sentence

2forward-word

 Cforward-wordforward-word–l rMove past the next word.Alt-F—

By default, a word consists of a sequence of letters or underscores.
The buffer-specific variable ¬word-pattern≈word-pattern contains
a regular expression that defines Epsilon's notion of a word for the
current buffer.

“forward-word

2fundamental-mode

 Cfundamental-modefundamental-modeTurn off any special key definitions.

This command removes changes to key bindings made by modes such as C
mode or Dired mode.

Every buffer has a major mode, and whenever you type keys in that
buffer, Epsilon interprets them according to the buffer's mode.  Each
of Epsilon's various modes is suitable for editing a particular kind
of text.  Some modes only change the meanings of a few keys.  For
instance, C mode makes the ⁄Tab€ key indent the current line of C
code.  Other modes provide a group of new commands, usually on the
letter keys.  For example, in Dired mode the D key deletes a file.
Each major mode is also the name of a command which puts the current
buffer in that mode.  For example, Alt-X c-mode puts the current
buffer in C mode.

The default mode for new buffers is Fundamental Mode.  This command
returns the current buffer to Fundamental Mode, removing any changes
to key bindings installed by another mode.

“fundamental-mode

2gams-mode

 Cgams-modegams-modeSet up for editing GAMS files.

This command sets up syntax highlighting suitable for files in the
GAMS language used for mathematical programming.

“gams-mode

2goto-beginning

 Cgoto-beginninggoto-beginning–l rGo to the beginning of the buffer.Alt-<—

“goto-beginning

2goto-end

 Cgoto-endgoto-end–l rGo to the end of the buffer.Alt->—

“goto-end

2goto-line

 Cgoto-linegoto-line–l rGo to a certain line by number.Ctrl-X G—

This command moves point to the start of the ªnº'th line in the file,
where ªnº denotes the command's numeric argument.  With no numeric
argument, Epsilon will ask for the line number.  You may add :col
after the line number (or in place of it) to specify a column.

“goto-line

2goto-tag

 Cgoto-taggoto-tag–l rAsk for the name of a function, then go there.Ctrl-X .—

The command prompts you for the name of a tagged function, with
completion.  Epsilon then goes to the file and line where the
function definition appears.  If you give no name, Epsilon goes to
the next tag in the alphabetical tag list.  With a numeric argument,
it goes to the next tag without asking for a tag name.  Before moving
to the tag, it sets a bookmark at the current position like
set-bookmark.

“goto-tag

2grep

 Cgrepgrep–l rSearch multiple files for a pattern.Alt-F7—

This command lets you search a set of files for a pattern.  It
prompts for the search string and the file pattern.  Then it scans
the files, accumulating matching lines in the grep buffer.  The grep
buffer appears in the current window.  By default, the grep command
interprets the search string as a regular expression.  Press Ctrl-T
at the search string prompt to toggle regular expression mode.  You
can also type Ctrl-W or Ctrl-C to toggle word-mode or case-folding
searches, respectively.

At the file pattern prompt, you can press ⁄Enter€ if you want Epsilon
to search the same set of files as before.  Type Ctrl-S and Epsilon
will type in the directory part of the current buffer's file name;
this is convenient when you want to search other files in the same
directory as the current file.  As at other prompts, you can also
press Alt-⁄Up€ key or Alt-Ctrl-P to show a list of your previous
responses to the prompt.  Use the arrow keys or the mouse to choose a
previous response to repeat, and press ⁄Enter€.  If you want to edit
the response first, press Alt-E.

You can use extended file patterns to search in multiple directories
using a pattern like **\*.µc,cpp,h∂ (which searches in the
current directory tree for .c, .cpp, and .h files).  With a numeric
argument, grep instead searches through all buffers.  The buffer
name pattern must be a simple prefix if you use it, like "a" to
search all buffers whose names start with "a"; no wildcards are
permitted.

In grep mode, alphabetic keys run special grep commands.  See the
description of the grep-mode command for details.  Typing H or
"?" in grep mode gives help on grep subcommands.

“grep

2grep-mode

 Cgrep-modegrep-modeEdit a list of lines containing a search string.

In a grep buffer, you can move around by using the normal movement
commands.  Most alphabetic keys run special grep commands.  The "N"
and "P" keys move to the next and previous entries.  You can easily
go from the grep buffer to the corresponding locations in the
original files.  To do this, simply position point on the copy of the
line, then press ⁄Space€, ⁄Enter€, or "E".  The file appears in the
current window, with point positioned at the beginning of the
matching line.  Typing "1" brings up the file in a window that
occupies the entire screen.  Typing "2" splits the window
horizontally, then brings up the file in the lower window.  Typing
"5" splits the window vertically, then brings up the file.  Typing
"Z" runs the zoom-window command, then brings up the file.

“grep-mode

2help

 Chelphelp–l rGet documentation on commands.F1—

If executed during another command, help simply pops up the
description of that command.  Otherwise, you press another key to
specify one of the following options: Œ? prints
out this message.

Œk runs describe-key, which asks for the key, then gives full
help on the command bound to that key.

Œc runs describe-command, which asks for the command name, then
gives full help on that command, along with its bindings.

Œr runs describe-variable, which asks for the variable name,
then shows the full help on that variable.

Œi runs the info command, which starts Info mode.  Info mode
lets you read the entire Epsilon manual, as well as any other
documentation you may have in Info format.

ŒCtrl-C runs the info-goto-epsilon-command command, which
prompts for the name of an Epsilon command, then displays an Info
page from Epsilon's online manual that describes the command.

ŒCtrl-K runs the info-goto-epsilon-key command, which prompts
for a key, then displays an Info page from Epsilon's online manual
that describes the command it runs.

ŒCtrl-V runs the info-goto-epsilon-variable command, which
prompts for an Epsilon variable's name, then displays an Info page
from Epsilon's online manual that describes that variable.

Œf runs the epsilon-info-look-up command, which prompts for a
topic, then starts Info mode and looks up that topic in the Epsilon
manual.

Œh displays Epsilon's manual in HTML format, by running a web
browser.  It prompts for a topic, which can be a command or variable
name, or any other text.  (The browser will try to find an exact
match for what you type; if not, it will search for web pages
containing that word.)  When you're looking at Epsilon's manual in
Info mode, using one of the previous commands, this command will
default to showing the same topic in a browser.

Œw runs the WinHelp program to display Epsilon's online manual, in
Epsilon for Windows.

Œa runs apropos which asks for a string, then lists commands
and variables apropos that string.

Œb runs show-bindings, which asks for a command name, then
gives you its bindings.

Œq runs what-is, which asks for a key, then tells you what
command runs when you type that key.

Œl runs show-last-keys, which pops up a window that contains
the last 60 keystrokes you typed.

Œv runs about-epsilon, which displays the current Epsilon
version number and similar information.

Œm shows documentation on the current buffer's major mode.  

“help

2highlight-region

 Chighlight-regionhighlight-region–l rHighlight area between point and mark.Ctrl-X Ctrl-H—

This command toggles highlighting of the region of the buffer between
point and mark.  If you prefix a nonzero numeric argument, the
command highlights the region; a numeric argument of zero turns
highlighting off.

“highlight-region

2html-mode

 Chtml-modehtml-modeSet up for editing Hypertext Markup Language files.

This command puts the current buffer in HTML mode.  Epsilon will do
syntax-highlighting for HTML and brace-matching.

“html-mode

2import-colors

 Cimport-colorsimport-colorsLoad color choices from earlier versions.

Use this command to import your color choices from Epsilon version 7
or earlier.  It uses the same "changes" file as the
load-changes command.  The end result will be a mycolors.e file,
which you can compile and load into Epsilon with the
compile-buffer command on Alt-F3.  When you receive a new version
of Epsilon, you'll be able to easily import your color changes by
recompiling this file.

Once you've loaded your color choices, you may need to use the
set-color command to select the particular color scheme you
modified.  The import-colors command doesn't change which color
scheme Epsilon uses, only the color choices making up the scheme.

“import-colors

2incremental-search

 Cincremental-searchincremental-search–l rSearch for a string as you type it.Ctrl-S—

Ctrl-Q quotes the next character.  Backspace cancels the last
character.  Ctrl-S repeats a forward search, and Ctrl-R repeats a
backward search, or they change its direction.  Ctrl-R or Ctrl-S with
an empty search string brings back the search string from the
previous search.  Ctrl-O enables or disables incremental mode.
Incremental mode searches as you type; non-incremental mode lets you
edit the search string.

Ctrl-W enables or disables word searching, restricting matches to
complete words.  Ctrl-T enables or disables regular expression
searching, in which the search string specifies a pattern (see
regex-search for rules).  Ctrl-C enables or disables
case-folding.  ⁄Enter€ or ⁄Esc€ exits the search, leaving point alone.

If Epsilon cannot find all the input string, it doesn't discard the
portion it cannot find.  You can delete it, discard it all with
Ctrl-G, use Ctrl-R or Ctrl-S to search the other way, change modes,
or exit from the search.

During incremental searching, if you type Control or Alt keys not
mentioned above, Epsilon exits the search and executes the command
bound to the key.  During a non-incremental search, most Control and
Alt keys edit the search string itself.

Quitting (with Ctrl-G) a successful search aborts the search and
moves point back; quitting a failing search just discards the portion
of the search string that Epsilon could not find.

“incremental-search

2indent-for-comment

 Cindent-for-commentindent-for-comment–l rIndent and insert a comment.Alt-;—

This command creates a comment on the current line, using the
commenting style of the current language mode.  The comment begins at
the column specified by the comment-column variable (by default
40).  (However, if the comment is the first thing on the line and
¬indent-comment-as-code≈indent-comment-as-code is nonzero, it
indents to the column specified by the buffer's language-specific
indentation function.)  If the line already has a comment, this
command reindents the comment to the comment column.

With a numeric argument, this command doesn't insert a comment, but
instead searches for one.  With a negative numeric argument, it
searches backwards for a comment.

“indent-for-comment

2indent-previous

 Cindent-previousindent-previous–l rIndent based on the previous line.⁄Tab€—

This command makes the current line start at the same column as the
previous non-blank line.  Specifically, if you invoke this command
with point in or adjacent to a line's indentation,
indent-previous replaces that indentation with the indentation of
the previous non-blank line.  If point's indentation exceeds that of
the previous non-blank line, or if you invoke this command with point
outside of the line's indentation, this command simply inserts a tab
character.

If a region is highlighted, Epsilon indents all lines in the region
by one tab stop.  With a numeric prefix argument, Epsilon indents by
that amount.

“indent-previous

2indent-region

 Cindent-regionindent-region–l rIndent from point to mark using the function on ⁄Tab€.Ctrl-Alt-¥—

This command goes to the start of each line in the region and does
what the ⁄Tab€ key would do if pressed.  It then deletes any
resulting lines that contain only spaces and tabs, replacing them
with newline characters.

“indent-region

2indent-rigidly

 Cindent-rigidlyindent-rigidly–l rMove all lines in the region left or right by a fixed amount.Ctrl-X Ctrl-I—

This command finds the indentation of each line in the region, and
augments it by the value of the numeric argument.  With a negative
numeric argument, ª-nº, the command removes ªnº columns from each
line's indentation.

“indent-rigidly

2indent-under

 Cindent-underindent-under–l rIndent to the next text on the previous line.Ctrl-Alt-I—

This function starts at the current column on the previous non-blank
line, and moves right until it reaches the column where a run of
non-spaces starts.  It then replaces the indentation at point with
indentation that reaches to this column by inserting tabs and spaces.
If the previous non-blank line has no such pattern, it inserts a tab.

If a region is highlighted, Epsilon indents all lines in the region
by one tab stop.  With a numeric prefix argument, Epsilon indents by
that amount.

“indent-under

2info

 Cinfoinfo–l rRead documentation in Info format.F1 i—

This command starts Epsilon's Info mode for reading Info-format
documentation.  Use "q" to switch back to the previous buffer.
Commands like ⁄Space€ and ⁄Backspace€, N and P, navigate through the
tree-structured Info hierarchy.  See info-mode for details.

“info

2info-backward-node

 Cinfo-backward-nodeinfo-backward-node–l rWalk the leaves of the Info hierarchy in reverse.Info: [—

This command goes to the previous node in the sequence of Info nodes
formed by walking the leaves of the hierarchy within the current Info
file.

In detail, it goes to the previous node, then as long as it's on a
node with a menu, goes to the last menu item.  However, if there's no
previous node (or it's the same as the current node's parent), it
goes up to the parent node as long as it's in the same file.

“info-backward-node

2info-directory-node

 Cinfo-directory-nodeinfo-directory-node–l rGo to the Directory node.Info: D—

Info nodes are arranged in a hierarchy.  At the top of the hierarchy

This command goes to the next node in the sequence of Info nodes
formed by walking the leaves of the hierarchy within the current Info
file.

In detail, if a menu is visible in the window, go to its next item
after point.  Otherwise, go to this node's next node.  (If there is
no next node, go up until reaching a node with a next node first, but
never to the Top node.)

“info-forward-node

2info-goto

 Cinfo-gotoinfo-goto–l rAsk for a node's name, then go there.Info: G—

This command prompts for the name of a node, then goes to it.  It

2jump-to-column

 Cjump-to-columnjump-to-column–l rGo to the specified column.Alt-g—

This command prompts for a number, then moves to the specified column
on the current line.  In horizontal scrolling mode, it then
horizontally centers the window on that column (or, if possible,
positions the window so that the start of the line is also visible).
You can specify the column with a numeric prefix argument and avoid
the prompt.

2jump-to-dvi

DVI files, previewing Cjump-to-dvijump-to-dvi–l rShow the DVI output from this TeX material.TeX mode: Alt-Shift-J—

In a TeX buffer, this command tells a
running MS-Windows DVI previewer to display the DVI output resulting
from the text near point.

The DVI viewer must understand Epsilon's messages.  Y&Y's
"DVIWindo" previewer, version 2.1.4 and later, understands them.
And your TeX (or LaTeX) file must input srctex.sty (or srcltx.sty) to
include file name and line number information in your DVI file.  Your
TeX vendor can supply these.

For documents made from multiple TeX files, Epsilon can't determine
the ultimate DVI file name by examining one of the component TeX
files.  So the appropriate DVI file must already be open in the
viewer.  (Epsilon builds a DVI file name by replacing the current TeX
file's extension with .dvi.  If a file with that name exists,
Epsilon tells the previewer to load it.  Otherwise Epsilon assumes
the DVI file is already loaded in the previewer.)

“jump-to-dvi

2jump-to-last-bookmark

 Cjump-to-last-bookmarkjump-to-last-bookmark–l rGo to a previously recorded place.Alt-J—

Use this command to jump to a location that you previously set with
the set-bookmark command.  If you repeatedly press this key, you
will cycle through the last 10 temporary bookmarks.

“jump-to-last-bookmark

2jump-to-named-bookmark

 Cjump-to-named-bookmarkjump-to-named-bookmark–l rGo to a named bookmark.Ctrl-X J—

Use this command to jump to a location that you previously saved with
the set-named-bookmark command.  The command prompts for a
bookmark name (a letter), then jumps to that bookmark.

If you specify a digit instead of a letter, the command jumps to the
corresponding temporary bookmark (set with set-bookmark).  Zero
refers to the last such temporary bookmark, one to the previous one,
and so one.

You can press "?" to get a list of the currently defined bookmarks,
along with the text that contains the bookmarks.  To select one,
simply move to the desired bookmark and press ⁄Enter€.

2keep-duplicate-lines

 Ckeep-duplicate-lineskeep-duplicate-linesRemove unduplicated lines.

This command deletes all lines that only occur once, and leaves one
copy of each duplicated line.  Also see the uniq and
keep-unique-lines command.

“keep-duplicate-lines

2keep-matching-lines

 Ckeep-matching-lineskeep-matching-linesDelete all lines but those containing a regex pattern.

This command prompts for a regular expression pattern.  It then
deletes all lines below point in the current buffer except those that
contain the pattern.  While you type the pattern, Ctrl-W enables or
disables word searching, restricting matches to complete words.
Ctrl-T enables or disables regular expression searching, in which the
search string specifies a pattern (see regex-search for rules).
Ctrl-C enables or disables case-folding.

“keep-matching-lines

2keep-unique-lines

 Ckeep-unique-lineskeep-unique-linesEntirely remove duplicate lines.

This command deletes all copies of any duplicated lines.  Also see
the uniq and keep-duplicate-lines command.

2kill-all-buffers

 Ckill-all-bufferskill-all-buffersDelete all user buffers.

This command discards all of Epsilon's buffers (except hidden system
buffers).

“kill-all-buffers

2kill-buffer

 Ckill-bufferkill-buffer–l rMake a specified buffer not exist.Ctrl-X K—

This command asks for a buffer name and then deletes that buffer.
The command warns you before deleting a buffer that contains unsaved
changes.

“kill-buffer

2kill-comment

 Ckill-commentkill-commentKill the next comment.

This command searches forward for a comment, as defined by the
current mode, then kills it.  The set-comment-column command
invokes this command if given a negative numeric argument.

“kill-comment

2kill-current-buffer

 Ckill-current-bufferkill-current-buffer–l rMake the current buffer not exist.Ctrl-X Ctrl-K—

This command deletes the current buffer and switches to another,
creating a new buffer if necessary.  The command warns you first if
the current buffer contains unsaved changes.

“kill-current-buffer

2kill-current-line

 Ckill-current-linekill-current-lineKill the current line.

This command kills the entire current line, including any newline at
its end.  The killed text goes to a kill buffer for possible later
retrieval.

“kill-current-line

2kill-level

 Ckill-levelkill-level–l rKill a bracketed expression.Ctrl-Alt-K—

The command moves point as in forward-level, killing the
characters it passes over.

“kill-level

2kill-line

 Ckill-linekill-line–l rKill to end of line.Ctrl-K—

If invoked with point at the end of a line, this command kills the
newline.  Otherwise, it kills the rest of the line but not the
newline.  If you give kill-line a numeric argument, it kills that
many lines and newlines.  The killed text goes to a kill buffer for
possible later retrieval.

“kill-line

2kill-process

 Ckill-processkill-processGet rid of the concurrent process.

Under Epsilon for Windows or Unix, this command disconnects Epsilon
from a concurrent process and makes it exit.

 Ckill-rectanglekill-rectangleKill the rectangular area between point and mark.

This command removes the characters in the rectangular area between
point and mark, and puts them in a kill buffer.

“kill-rectangle

2kill-region

 Ckill-regionkill-region–l rKill the text between point and mark.Ctrl-W—

This command removes the characters between point and mark from the
buffer, and puts them in a kill buffer.

“kill-region

2kill-sentence

 Ckill-sentencekill-sentence–l rKill to the end of the sentence.Alt-K—

The command moves point as in ¬forward-sentence, killing the
characters it passes over.

“kill-sentence

2kill-to-end-of-line

 Ckill-to-end-of-linekill-to-end-of-line–l rKill the remainder of the current line.Brief: Alt-K—

This command kills the remainder of the current line, not including
any newline at its end.  If point is at the end of the line, the
command does nothing.  The killed text goes to a kill buffer for
possible later retrieval.

“kill-to-end-of-line

2kill-window

 Ckill-windowkill-window–l rDelete the current window.Ctrl-X 0—

This command gets rid of the current window, and gives the space to
some other window.  This command does not delete the buffer displayed
in the window.

“kill-window

2kill-word

 Ckill-wordkill-word–l rKill the word after point.Alt-D—

The command moves point forward through the buffer as with
forward-word, then kills the region it traversed.

“kill-word

2last-kbd-macro

 Clast-kbd-macrolast-kbd-macro–l rExecute the last keyboard macro defined from the keyboard.Ctrl-F4—

This command runs the last keyboard macro you defined with the
start-kbd-macro and end-kbd-macro commands.

“last-kbd-macro

2latex-mode

 Clatex-modelatex-modeSet up for editing LaTeX documents.

This command sets up Epsilon for editing LaTeX documents.  Keys in
LaTeX mode include Alt-i for italic text, Alt-Shift-I for slanted
text, Alt-Shift-T for typewriter, Alt-Shift-B for boldface,
Alt-Shift-C for small caps, Alt-Shift-F for a footnote, and Alt-s for
a centered line.  Alt-Shift-E prompts for the name of a LaTeX
environment, then inserts ¥beginµ»env…∂ and ¥endµ»env…∂ lines.

For all these commands, you can highlight a block of text first and
Epsilon will make the text italic, slanted, etc. or you can use the
command and then type the text to be italic, slanted, etc.

The keys "µ" and "$" insert matched pairs of characters (either µ∂ or
$$), the keys ⁄Comma€ and ⁄Period€ remove a preceding italic
correction ¥/, the " key inserts the appropriate kind of
doublequote sequence like `` or '', and Alt-" inserts an
actual " character.

“latex-mode

2line-to-bottom

 Cline-to-bottomline-to-bottom–l rScroll window to move this line to bottom.Brief: Ctrl-B—

This command tries to scroll the current window so that the line
containing point becomes the last line in the window.

“line-to-bottom

2line-to-top

 Cline-to-topline-to-top–l rScroll the window to move this line to the top.Brief: Ctrl-T—

This command tries to scroll the current window so that the line
containing point becomes the first line in the window.

“line-to-top

2list-all

 Clist-alllist-allDescribe Epsilon's state in text form.

This command puts a description of Epsilon's state, including
bindings, macros, variables, and commands, in a buffer named
list-all.  It provides complete descriptions for bindings, macros,
and simple variables, but for commands and subroutines, it only
records the fact that a function with that name exists.  You would
use this command when updating to a new version of Epsilon.

“list-all

2list-bookmarks

 Clist-bookmarkslist-bookmarksPop up a list of all the bookmarks.

This command works like jump-to-named-bookmark, but pops up a
list of bookmarks, as if you had typed "?" to that command.  If you
always want the pop up list, you can bind this command to a key
(perhaps replacing the default binding of jump-to-named-bookmark
on Ctrl-X J).

“list-bookmarks

2list-changes

 Clist-changeslist-changesList variables added or changed when updating.

You would use this command when updating to a new version of Epsilon.
It asks for the names of two files, then makes a list of all lines
from the second that don't appear in the first.  It sorts the second
file, but not the first.

“list-changes

2list-colors

 Clist-colorslist-colorsMake a list of all color settings.

This command constructs a buffer with all of Epsilon's current color
settings, one to a line.  The export-colors command is usually a
better way to save color selections in human-readable form.

“list-colors

2list-definitions

 Clist-definitionslist-definitions–l rList functions defined in this file.Alt-'—

This command displays a list of all functions and global variables
defined in the current file.  It uses Epsilon's tagging facility, so
it works for any file type where tagging works.

You can move to a definition in the list and press ⁄Enter€ and
Epsilon will go to that definition.  Or press Ctrl-G to remain at the
starting point.

By default, it skips over external declarations.  With a prefix
numeric argument, it includes those too.  (If the buffer contains
only external declarations and no definitions, a prefix argument is
unnecessary; Epsilon will automatically include them.)

“list-definitions

2list-files

 Clist-fileslist-filesCreate a buffer listing all files matching a pattern.

This command prompts for a file name pattern containing wildcards,
then creates a list of all the files matching the pattern in a buffer
named "file-list".  Use this command when you need a plain list of
file names, without any of the extra information that the similar
dired command provides.

With a numeric argument, the command lists matching directory names,
as well as file names.

“list-files

2list-make-preprocessor-conditionals

 Clist-make-preprocessor-conditionalslist-make-preprocessor-conditionals–l rShow conditionals in effect for this line.Makefile mode: Alt-i—

In makefile mode buffers, this command displays a list of all
preprocessor conditionals that affect the current line.

“list-make-preprocessor-conditionals

2list-preprocessor-conditionals

 Clist-preprocessor-conditionalslist-preprocessor-conditionals–l rShow conditionals in effect for this line.C mode: Alt-i—

In C mode buffers, this command displays a list of all preprocessor
conditionals that affect the current line.

“list-preprocessor-conditionals

2list-svga-modes

 Clist-svga-modeslist-svga-modesList or load additional SVGA video modes.

Under DOS, this command lists any Super VGA video modes available,
putting the result in a buffer named "svga-list".  You must set the
¬extra-video-modes≈extra-video-modes variable and restart for
this command to work.

Under OS/2, this command works differently.  You must run this
command before you can access the additional video modes.  (Under
DOS, the modes are available immediately, and this command is purely
informational.)  The command scans the file SVGADATA.PMI for new
Super VGA video modes and adds them to Epsilon.  SVGADATA.PMI is
a text file describing all the available modes for your video board.
It normally resides in your main ¥OS2 directory, and is built by
the SVGA program which comes with OS/2.  See your OS/2 documentation
for information on this program.

“list-svga-modes

2list-undefined

 Clist-undefinedlist-undefinedWhich EEL functions are not defined anywhere?

This command makes a list of all EEL functions that are called from
some other EEL function, but have not been defined.  Epsilon doesn't
report any error when you load an EEL function that refers to an
undefined function, but you'll get an error message when the function
runs.  This command helps to prevent such errors.  The list also
includes any variables or functions that have been deleted.

“list-undefined

2load-buffer

 Cload-bufferload-bufferInterpret a buffer as a command file.

This command prompts you for the name of a buffer containing macro
definitions and key bindings in command file format, then executes
the commands contained in that buffer.  For information on command
file format, see the section of the manual entitled "Command Files".

“load-buffer

2load-bytes

 Cload-bytesload-bytes–l rLoad compiled EEL commands and variables.F3—

This command prompts you for the name of a file produced by the EEL
compiler, then loads that file.  You may omit the file name's
extension.  The command changes any file name extension you provide
to ".b".

“load-bytes

2load-changes

 Cload-changesload-changesLoad the changes into Epsilon.

The load-changes command prompts for a file name, then loads the
changes described in that file.  Use this command when updating to a
new version of Epsilon, to load the output of the list-changes
command.

“load-changes

2load-file

 Cload-fileload-fileRead in a command file.

This command prompts you for the name of a command file containing
macro definitions and key bindings, then executes the commands
contained in that file.  For information on command file format, see
the section of the manual entitled "Command Files".

“load-file

2locate-file

 Clocate-filelocate-fileSearch for a file.

This command prompts you for a file name and then searches for that
file.  In Windows, DOS, and OS/2, it searches for the file on all
local hard drives, skipping over removable drives, CD-ROM drives, and
network drives.  On Unix, it searches through particular parts of the
directory hierarchy specified by the
¬locate-path-unix≈locate-path-unix variable.

“locate-file

2lowercase-word

 Clowercase-wordlowercase-word–l rMake the current word lower case.Alt-L—

Point travels forward through the buffer as with forward-word.
It turns all the letters it encounters to lower case.  If the current
buffer contains a highlighted region, Epsilon instead changes all the
letters in the region to lower case, leaving point unchanged.

“lowercase-word

2make

 Cmakemake–l rRun a program, then look for errors.Ctrl-X M—

Execute a program (by default "make") as the push command does.
With a numeric argument, the command prompts for the program to
execute and sets the default for next time.  Epsilon captures the
program's output and parses it for error messages using the
next-error command.

“make

2makefile-mode

 Cmakefile-modemakefile-modeSet up for editing makefiles.

This command sets up syntax highlighting suitable for makefiles.

“makefile-mode

2man

 CmanmanRead Unix man pages.

This command prompts for a line of text, then runs the Unix "man"
command, passing that text as its command line argument, and displays
the result in a buffer.

If you don't use any flags or section names, Epsilon will provide
completion on available topics.  For example, type "?" to see all
man page topics available.  Within man page output, you can
double-click on a reference to another man page, such as echo(1),
or press ⁄Enter€ to follow it, or press m to be prompted for another
man page topic.

“man

2mark-c-paragraph

 Cmark-c-paragraphmark-c-paragraph–l rSet point and mark around a paragraph.C mode: Alt-h—

This command sets point and mark around the current paragraph in a
block comment in C mode.

“mark-c-paragraph

2mark-inclusive-region

 Cmark-inclusive-regionmark-inclusive-region–l rBegin marking a Brief-style inclusive region.Brief: Alt-M—

This command begins marking and highlighting a region of text,
defining it as an inclusive region.  An inclusive region includes all
the characters between point and mark, plus one additional character
at the end of the region.  When you run this command, it sets the
mark equal to the value of point, so initially the highlighted region
has one character, the character just after point.  This is Brief's
normal region type.

If Epsilon is already highlighting a region of another type, this
command redefines the region as an inclusive region.  If
¬mark-unhighlights≈mark-unhighlights is nonzero and Epsilon is
already highlighting an inclusive region, this command turns off the
highlighting.

“mark-inclusive-region

2mark-line-region

 Cmark-line-regionmark-line-region–l rBegin marking a line region.Brief: Alt-L—

This command begins marking and highlighting a region of text,
defining it as a line region.  A line region includes complete lines
of the buffer: the line containing point, the line containing the
mark and all the lines between them.  When you run this command, it
sets the mark equal to the value of point, so initially the
highlighted region contains just the current line.

If Epsilon is already highlighting a region of another type, this
command redefines the region as a line region.  If
¬mark-unhighlights≈mark-unhighlights is nonzero and Epsilon is
already highlighting a line region, this command turns off the
highlighting.

“mark-line-region

2mark-normal-region

 Cmark-normal-regionmark-normal-region–l rBegin marking a normal region.Brief: Alt-A—

This command begins marking and highlighting a region of text,
defining it as a normal (non-inclusive) region.  A normal region
includes all the characters between point and mark.  When you run
this command, it sets the mark equal to the value of point, so
initially the highlighted region is empty.

If Epsilon is already highlighting a region of another type, this
command redefines the region as a normal region.  If
¬mark-unhighlights≈mark-unhighlights is nonzero and Epsilon is
already highlighting a normal region, this command turns off the
highlighting.  See set-mark for a command that always begins
defining a new region, even when a region has already been
highlighted.

“mark-normal-region

2mark-paragraph

 Cmark-paragraphmark-paragraph–l rPut point and mark around the paragraph.Alt-H—

This command positions mark before the first character in the current
paragraph, and positions point after the last character in the
paragraph.  You can use this command in conjunction with the
kill-region command to kill paragraphs and move them around.

For information on Epsilon's notion of a paragraph, see the help
entry for the ¬forward-paragraph command.

“mark-paragraph

2mark-rectangle

 Cmark-rectanglemark-rectangle–l rBegin marking a rectangular region.Ctrl-x #, Brief: Alt-C—

This command begins marking and highlighting a rectangular region of
text, setting mark equal to the value of point.  A rectangular region
consists of all columns between those of point and mark, on all lines
in the buffer between point and mark.

If Epsilon is already highlighting a region of another type, this
command redefines the region as a rectangular region.  If
¬mark-unhighlights≈mark-unhighlights is nonzero and Epsilon is
already highlighting a rectangular region, this command turns off the
highlighting.

“mark-rectangle

2mark-whole-buffer

 Cmark-whole-buffermark-whole-buffer–l rHighlight the entire buffer.Ctrl-X H—

This command sets point at the start of the current and mark at its
end, and turns on highlighting.

“mark-whole-buffer

2merge-diff

 Cmerge-diffmerge-diffUse #ifdef to mark buffer changes.

This command is another variation on diff that's useful with
buffers in C mode.  It marks differences by surrounding them with
#ifdef preprocessor lines, first prompting for the #ifdef variable
name to use.  The resulting buffer receives the mode and settings of
the first of the original buffers.

“merge-diff

2mouse-center

 Cmouse-centermouse-center–l rPan or yank, as appropriate.M-⁄Center€—

This command runs mouse-yank under Unix, and mouse-pan
otherwise.  See the variable
¬mouse-center-yanks≈mouse-center-yanks to customize this behavior.

“mouse-center

2mouse-move

 Cmouse-movemouse-move–l rPop up a scroll bar or menu bar as needed.M-⁄Move€—

Epsilon runs this command when you move the mouse.  It pops up a
scroll bar or menu bar, or changes the mouse cursor's shape, based on
the mouse's current position on the screen.

“mouse-move

2mouse-pan

 Cmouse-panmouse-pan–l rAutoscroll or pan the current buffer.M-⁄Center€—

This command is bound to the middle mouse button on three button (or
wheeled) mice.  It provides autoscrolling and panning when you click
that button.

“mouse-pan

2mouse-select

 Cmouse-selectmouse-select–l rSelect text, move borders, or run menu command.M-⁄Left€—

Press and release this mouse button to position point to wherever the
mouse cursor indicates, switching windows if needed.  Hold down the
mouse button and drag to select and highlight text.  Double-clicking
selects full words.  (When a pop-up list of choices appears on the
screen, double-clicking on a choice selects it.)  Shift-clicking
extends the current selection.  Holding down the Alt key while
selecting produces a rectangle selection.

Drag selected text to move it someplace else.  Hold down the Control
key to copy the text someplace else.

On scroll bars, this button scrolls the window.  You can drag the
central scroll box up and down, click on the arrows at the top and
bottom of the scroll bar to scroll by lines, or click between the
arrows and the box to scroll by pages.

On other window borders and corners, dragging resizes windows.  For
pop-up windows only, dragging the title bar moves the window.

“mouse-select

2mouse-to-tag

 Cmouse-to-tagmouse-to-tag–l rGo to the definition of the indicated function.M-⁄Right€—

In Epsilon for Windows, display the context menu by calling the
context-menu command.  In other versions, behave like the left
mouse button, with one exception:

In C files, double-clicking on the name of a subroutine jumps to that
routine's definition using the tags system.  Before jumping, it sets
a bookmark at the current position like the set-bookmark command.

“mouse-to-tag

2mouse-yank

 Cmouse-yankmouse-yank–l rYank from the clipboard or kill buffer.Unix: M-⁄Center€—

This command yanks text from the clipboard or a kill buffer, like the
yank command, at the mouse's current location.

“mouse-yank

2move-to-window

 Cmove-to-windowmove-to-window–l rMove to a different window.Ctrl-X ⁄Arrows€—

This command changes the current window to the window in the
direction of the arrow key from the cursor.  For example, typing
Ctrl-X ⁄Right€ moves to the window to the right of the cursor; Ctrl-X
⁄Left€ moves to the left.  Ctrl-X ⁄Up€ and Ctrl-X ⁄Down€ move up and
down, respectively.

“move-to-window

2name-kbd-macro

 Cname-kbd-macroname-kbd-macro–l rName the last keyboard macro defined.Ctrl-X Alt-N—

Use this command to give a name to a keyboard macro that you defined
with ¬start-kbd-macro and ¬end-kbd-macro.  The command prompts
you for the name.  Thereafter, you may invoke that macro by name
using ¬named-command, or bind it to a key using ¬bind-to-key.

“name-kbd-macro

2named-command

 Cnamed-commandnamed-command–l rInvoke the given command by name.Alt-X—

This command prompts for the name of a command or keyboard macro,
with completion, then executes it.

“named-command

2narrow-to-region

 Cnarrow-to-regionnarrow-to-regionTemporarily restrict editing to between point and mark.

This command temporarily restricts your access to the current buffer.
Point can only vary between the values point and mark had when you
invoked narrow-to-region.  The commands that go to the beginning
and end of the buffer will instead go to the beginning and end of
this region.  Searches will only operate within the region.  However,
the commands that write the buffer to a file will write the entire
buffer, not just the constricted region.  See also the
widen-buffer command.

“narrow-to-region

2new-file

 Cnew-filenew-fileCreate an empty buffer.

This command creates a new, empty buffer and marks it so that Epsilon
will prompt for a file name when you try to save it.  You can
customize the behavior of the new-file command by setting the
variables new-file-mode and new-file-ext.

“new-file

2next-buffer

 Cnext-buffernext-buffer–l rSelect the next buffer.F12—

This command selects the next buffer and connects it to the current
window.  You can cycle through all the buffers by repeating this
command.  To cycle in the other direction, use the
previous-buffer command.

“next-buffer

2next-difference

 Cnext-differencenext-difference–l rMove to the next change.Vdiff: Alt-⁄Down€ or Alt-]—

Use this command in a buffer created by the visual-diff command
to move to the next group of changed lines, or the next group of
common lines.  Added lines are shown in yellow, deleted lines in red,
and common lines are colored as in the original buffers.

“next-difference

2next-error

 Cnext-errornext-errorFind a compiler error message, then jump to the offending line.

This command searches in the process buffer for a line containing a
compiler error message.  Epsilon uses a regular expression search to
recognize these messages.

If a window displays the file containing the error, Epsilon switches
to that window.  Otherwise, it uses the find-file command to
display the file in the current window.  It then goes to the
indicated line of the file using the goto-line command, then
displays the error message in the echo area.  A positive numeric
argument of ªnº moves to the ªnºth next error message.  A negative
numeric argument of ª-nº moves to the ªnºth previous error message.
A numeric argument of zero repeats the last message.

“next-error

2next-match

 Cnext-matchnext-matchGo to the next matching line.

This command moves to the next match that the last grep command found.

If a window displays the file containing the match, Epsilon switches
to that window.  Otherwise, it uses the find-file command to
display the file in the current window.  It then goes to the matching
line.  A positive numeric argument of ªnº moves to the ªnºth next
match.  A negative numeric argument of ª-nº moves to the ªnºth
previous match.  A numeric argument of zero goes to the same match as
last time.

“next-match

2next-page

 Cnext-pagenext-page–l rDisplay the next window full of text.Ctrl-V—

This command scrolls the current window up so that the last few lines
appear at the top of the window.  It moves point so that it appears
centered vertically in the window.

“next-page

2next-position

 Cnext-positionnext-position–l rGo to the next matching line.Ctrl-X Ctrl-N—

This command moves to the next compiler error message by calling
next-error, or to the next match found by the grep command by
calling next-match, depending on whether you've run a process or
compilation command, or a grep command, most recently.

If a window displays the file containing the match, Epsilon switches
to that window.  Otherwise, it uses the find-file command to
display the file in the current window.  It then goes to the
appropriate line of the file.  A positive numeric argument of ªnº
moves to the ªnºth next match.  A negative numeric argument of ª-nº
moves to the ªnºth previous match.  A numeric argument of zero goes
to the same place as last time.

“next-position

2next-tag

 Cnext-tagnext-tag–l rGo to the next tag with this name.Ctrl-⁄NumPlus€—

After you use the goto-tag or pluck-tag commands to go to a
tag that occurs in multiple places, you can use this command to go to
the next instance of the tag.

“next-tag

2next-video

 Cnext-videonext-video–l rChange the number of lines or columns.Ctrl-F5—

This command tries to put the display device in a mode that displays
a different number of lines or columns.  This command cycles through
all the modes that Epsilon knows about.  See also the set-video
command.  (DOS, OS/2 only)

“next-video

2next-window

 Cnext-windownext-window–l rMove to the next window.Alt-⁄End€—

This command moves to the next window, wrapping around to the first
window if invoked from the last window.

You can think of the window order as the position of a window in a
list of windows.  Initially only one window appears in the list.
When you split a window, the two child windows replace it in the

2normal-character

 Cnormal-characternormal-characterInsert the invoking key into the buffer.

When you type a character bound to the normal-character command,
Epsilon inserts the character into the buffer, generally before
point.  See also the overwrite-mode command.

Nothing happens if the key that invokes normal-character does not
represent a valid 8-bit ASCII character.

During auto fill mode, when you type a key bound to this command, the
line breaks if appropriate.  In particular, if point's column equals
the fill column, the command breaks the line.  If the value of
point's column exceeds the fill column, the command breaks the line
at the closest whitespace to the left of the fill column, and uses
the normal-character command to insert a space.  Otherwise, this
command just invokes the normal-character command to insert the
key into the buffer.  See the auto-fill-mode command.

“normal-character

2oem-to-ansi

 Coem-to-ansioem-to-ansiConvert buffer's DOS character set to Windows.

Windows programs typically use a different character set than do DOS
programs.  The DOS character set is known as the DOS/OEM character
set, and includes various line drawing characters and miscellaneous
characters not in the Windows/ANSI set.  The Windows/ANSI character
set includes many accented characters not in the DOS/OEM character
set.  Epsilon for Windows uses the Windows/ANSI character set (with
most fonts).

The oem-to-ansi command converts the current buffer from the
DOS/OEM character set to the Windows/ANSI character set.  If any
character in the buffer doesn't have a unique translation, the
command warns first, and moves to the first character without a
unique translation.

This command ignores any narrowing established by the
narrow-to-region command.  It's only available in Epsilon for
Windows.

“oem-to-ansi

2one-window

 Cone-windowone-window–l rDisplay only one window.Ctrl-X 1—

The current window becomes the only window displayed.  The buffers
associated with other windows, if any, remain unaffected.  See also
the zoom-window command.

“one-window

2open-line

 Copen-lineopen-line–l rOpen up some vertical space.Ctrl-O—

This command inserts a newline after point, instead of before point
as the other inserting commands do.  Use this command to open up some
vertical space in the file.

“open-line

2overwrite-mode

 Coverwrite-modeoverwrite-mode–l rEnter/Exit overwrite mode.⁄Ins€—

This command changes the behavior of the normal-character
command, causing it to insert characters into the buffer
destructively, replacing the character after point.  However, Epsilon
will never overwrite a newline character, or overwrite another
character with a newline character.  This ensures proper behavior
with respect to the ends of lines.

Without a numeric argument, the command toggles the state of
overwrite mode.  With a numeric argument of zero, the command
disables overwrite mode.  With a nonzero numeric argument, it turns
overwrite mode on.

“overwrite-mode

2page-left

 Cpage-leftpage-left–l rShow more text to the left.Alt-⁄PageUp€—

This command moves left on the current line by half the window's
width.  In horizontal scrolling mode, it then horizontally centers
the window on that column (or, if possible, positions the window so
that the start of the line is also visible).

“page-left

2page-right

 Cpage-rightpage-right–l rShow more text to the right.Alt-⁄PageDown€—

This command moves right on the current line by half the window's
width.  In horizontal scrolling mode, it then horizontally centers
the window on that column (or, if possible, positions the window so
that the start of the line is also visible).

“page-right

2pause-macro

 Cpause-macropause-macro–l rSuspend/resume recording or running a macro.Shift-F4—

When defining a keyboard macro, pressing this key temporarily stops
recording the macro.  Press the same key again to resume recording.
Epsilon won't record any of your keystrokes while recording is
suspended.

When Epsilon runs the resulting keyboard macro, it will pause at the
same place in the macro and let you enter commands.  To resume the
macro, press this same key.

Use this command to write macros that pause in the middle for a file
name, or to let you do some custom editing, before continuing their
work.

“pause-macro

2perl-mode

 Cperl-modeperl-modeSet up for editing Perl.

This command puts the current buffer in a mode suitable for editing
Perl.

“perl-mode

2pluck-tag

 Cpluck-tagpluck-tag–l rGo to the definition of the function at point.Ctrl-X ,—

This command first retrieves the routine name adjacent to or to the
right of point, then jumps to that routine's definition.  Before
jumping, it sets a bookmark at the current position like
set-bookmark.

“pluck-tag

2postscript-mode

 Cpostscript-modepostscript-modeSet up for editing PostScript files.

This command sets up syntax highlighting suitable for PostScript
documents.

“postscript-mode

2previous-buffer

 Cprevious-bufferprevious-buffer–l rSelect the previous buffer.F11—

This command selects the previous buffer and connects it to the
current window.  You can cycle through all the buffers by repeating
this command.  To cycle in the other direction, use the
next-buffer command.

“previous-buffer

2previous-difference

 Cprevious-differenceprevious-difference–l rMove to the previous change.Vdiff: Alt-⁄Up€ or Alt-[—

Use this command in a buffer created by the visual-diff command
to move to the start of the previous group of changed lines, or the
previous group of common lines.  Added lines are shown in yellow,
deleted lines in red, and common lines are colored as in the original
buffers.

“previous-difference

2previous-error

 Cprevious-errorprevious-errorFind a compiler error message, then jump to the offending line.

This command works like next-error, except that it searches
backwards instead of forwards.

“previous-error

2previous-match

 Cprevious-matchprevious-matchGo to the previous matching line.

This command moves to the previous match from the last grep command.

If a window displays the file containing the match, Epsilon switches
to that window.  Otherwise, it uses the find-file command to
display the file in the current window.  It then goes to the matching
line.  A positive numeric argument of ªnº moves to the ªnºth previous
match.  A negative numeric argument of ª-nº moves to the ªnºth next
match.  A numeric argument of zero goes to the same match as last
time.

“previous-match

2previous-page

 Cprevious-pageprevious-page–l rDisplay the previous window full of text.Alt-V—

This command scrolls the contents of the current window down so that
the first few lines appear at the bottom of the window.  It moves
point so that it appears centered vertically in the window.

“previous-page

2previous-position

 Cprevious-positionprevious-position–l rGo to the previous matching line.Ctrl-X Ctrl-P—

This command moves to the previous compiler error message by calling
previous-error, or to the previous match found by the grep
command by calling previous-match, depending on whether you've
run a process or compilation command, or a grep command, most
recently.

If a window displays the file containing the match, Epsilon switches
to that window.  Otherwise, it uses the find-file command to
display the file in the current window.  It then goes to the
appropriate line of the file.  A positive numeric argument of ªnº
moves to the ªnºth previous match.  A negative numeric argument of
ª-nº moves to the ªnºth next match.  A numeric argument of zero goes
to the same place as last time.

“previous-position

2previous-tag

 Cprevious-tagprevious-tag–l rGo to the previous tag with this name.Ctrl-⁄NumMinus€—

After you use the goto-tag or pluck-tag commands to go to a
tag that occurs in multiple places, you can use this command to go to
the previous instance of the tag.

“previous-tag

2previous-window

 Cprevious-windowprevious-window–l rMove to the previous window.Alt-⁄Home€—

This command moves to the previous window, wrapping around to the
last window if invoked from the first window.

You can think of the window order as the position of a window in a
list of windows.  Initially only one window appears in the list.
When you split a window, the two child windows replace it in the
list.  The top or left window comes before the bottom or right
window.  When you delete a window, that window leaves the list.

“previous-window

2print-buffer

 Cprint-bufferprint-buffer–l rPrint the current buffer.Alt-F9—

This command prints the current buffer.  Under Windows, it displays
the standard Windows printing dialog.  You can choose to print the
current selection, the entire buffer, or just certain pages.

Under other environments, this command prints the current highlighted
region.  If no region in the buffer is highlighted, the command
prints the entire buffer.  It prompts for the device name of your
printer, storing your response in the variable
¬print-destination≈print-destination (or, under Unix,
¬print-destination-unix≈print-destination-unix), and then writes
a copy of the buffer to that device.  For DOS or OS/2, the printer
device name is typically something like LPT1 or COM2.

If the printer name begins with the ! character, Epsilon
interprets the remainder of the name as a command line to execute in
order to print a file.  Epsilon substitutes the file to be printed
for any %f sequence in the command line.  For example, if your
system requires you to type "netprint filename" to print a file,
enter !netprint %f as the device name and Epsilon will run that
command, passing it the file name of the temporary file it generates
holding the text to print.  The device name can include any of the
file name template sequences, such as %p for the path to the file
to print.

If the variable print-tabs is zero, Epsilon will make a copy of
the text to print and convert any tabs into spaces before sending it
to the printer.

“print-buffer

2print-buffer-no-prompt

 Cprint-buffer-no-promptprint-buffer-no-promptPrint the current buffer without prompting.

This command prints the current buffer, exactly like
print-buffer, but doesn't prompt.  It uses default settings.

“print-buffer-no-prompt

2print-region

 Cprint-regionprint-region–l rPrint the current region.Shift-F9—

Under Windows, this command displays the standard Windows printing
dialog.  You can choose to print the current selection, the entire
buffer, or just certain pages.

Under other environments, this command always prints the current
region.  It prompts for the device name of your printer, storing your
response in the variable ¬print-destination≈print-destination
(or, under Unix, ¬print-destination-unix≈print-destination-unix),
and then writes a copy of the region to that device.  For DOS or
OS/2, the printer device name is typically something like LPT1 or
COM2.

If the printer name begins with the ! character, Epsilon
interprets the remainder of the name as a command line to execute in
order to print a file.  Epsilon substitutes the file to be printed
for any %f sequence in the command line.  For example, if your
system requires you to type "netprint filename" to print a file,
enter !netprint %f as the device name and Epsilon will run that
command, passing it the file name of the temporary file it generates
holding the text to print.  The device name can include any of the
file name template sequences, such as %p for the path to the file
to print.

If the variable print-tabs is zero, Epsilon will make a copy of
the text to print and convert any tabs into spaces before sending it
to the printer.

“print-region

2print-setup

 Cprint-setupprint-setupDisplay the Print Setup dialog.

Under Windows, this command displays the standard Print Setup dialog.
You can choose a printer and select other options.  In other
environments, this command does nothing.

“print-setup

2process-enter

 Cprocess-enterprocess-enter–l rSend a line to the concurrent process.Process mode: ⁄Enter€—

Pressing the ⁄Enter€ key in process mode moves the error spot
backwards to point, so that Epsilon searches for error messages from
this new location.  If the process-enter-whole-line variable is
nonzero, Epsilon moves to the end of the current line before sending
it to the process, but only when in a line that has not yet been sent
to the process.  If the process-enter-whole-line variable is two,
Epsilon copies the current line to the end of the buffer, making it
easier to repeat a command.

“process-enter

2process-mode

 Cprocess-modeprocess-modeInteract with a concurrent process.

Epsilon puts its process buffer in this mode.  Pressing the ⁄Enter€
key in process mode moves the error spot backwards to point, so that
Epsilon searches for error messages from this new location.

“process-mode

2process-next-cmd

 Cprocess-next-cmdprocess-next-cmd–l rRetrieve the next command from the history list.Process: Alt-N—

Epsilon's concurrent process buffer maintains a command history.
This command retrieves the next command from the history.  Use it
following a process-previous-cmd command.

“process-next-cmd

2process-previous-cmd

 Cprocess-previous-cmdprocess-previous-cmd–l rRetrieve the previous command from the history list.Process: Alt-P—

Epsilon's concurrent process buffer maintains a command history.
This command retrieves the previous command from the history.  Also
see process-next-cmd command.

“process-previous-cmd

2profile

 CprofileprofileCollect timing information on EEL commands.

This command starts a recursive edit and begins collecting timing
data.  Many times per second, Epsilon makes a note of the currently
executing EEL source line.  When you exit with exit-level, it
fills a buffer named "profile" with this timing data.  Epsilon
doesn't collect any profiling information on commands or subroutines
that you compile with the -s option.  This command isn't available in
Epsilon for Windows 3.1.

“profile

2program-keys

 Cprogram-keysprogram-keysChange low-level key mapping.

This command presents a menu of choices that make changes to the keys
Epsilon can use (useful mainly under DOS).

“program-keys

2push

 Cpushpush–l rInvoke an inferior command processor.Ctrl-X Ctrl-E—

This command invokes a command processor, or shell.  While in the
command processor, you can do whatever you normally do outside of
Epsilon.  If you prefix a numeric argument, the command prompts you
for a line to pass to the command processor.  After the command
finishes, a message telling you to type any key to continue appears.
This allows you to look at your output before Epsilon again claims
the screen.  After you have passed a command to the command
processor, that command becomes the default command until you type in
another one.

Unlike start-process, this command will work with all but the
most extremely misbehaved programs.

“push

2query-replace

 Cquery-replacequery-replace–l rInteractively replace strings.Alt-%—

This command behaves like replace-string.  Instead of replacing
everything automatically, it positions point after each occurrence of
the old string, and you may select whether or not to replace it.
With a numeric argument, the command will match only complete words.
ŒY or ⁄Space€ replaces and goes to the next match.

ŒN or ⁄Backspace€ doesn't replace, but goes to the next match.

Œ⁄Esc€ exits immediately.

Œ. replaces and then exits.

Œ^ backs up to the previous match.

Œ! replaces all remaining occurrences.

Œ, replaces the current match but doesn't go to the next match.

ŒCtrl-R enters a recursive edit, allowing you to modify the buffer
arbitrarily.  When you exit the recursive edit with exit-level, the
query-replace continues.

ŒCtrl-G exits and returns point to its original location.

ŒCtrl-W toggles the state of word mode.

ŒCtrl-T toggles the state of regular expression mode (see the
description of regex-replace).

ŒCtrl-C toggles the state of case-folding.

ŒAny other key causes query-replace to exit and any command
bound to that key to execute.

2quick-dired-command

 Cquick-dired-commandquick-dired-command–l rPerform operations on the current file.Alt-o—

This command provides a convenient way to perform various operations
on the file associated with the current buffer.  It prompts for
another key, with choices as listed below.  Many of them are similar
to the corresponding commands in a dired buffer.  ŒD deletes the file associated with the current buffer, after
prompting for confirmation.

ŒC copies the file associated with the current buffer, prompting
for a destination.  If the buffer contains unsaved changes, they
won't be in the copy; this command affects the file on disk only.

ŒM renames or moves the file associated with the current buffer,
prompting for a destination.  It doesn't change the file name
associated with the current buffer, which will still refer to the
original file.

Œ⁄Period€ runs the dired command on the current file.

ŒG changes the current directory to the one containing the current
file.

Œ+ prompts for a subdirectory name, then creates a new subdirectory
in the directory containing the current file.

Œ! prompts for a command line, then runs that command, appending
the current file name to it.

ŒV runs the "viewer" for the current file; the program assigned
to it according to Windows file association.  For executable files,
it runs the program.  For document files, it typically runs the
Windows program assigned to that file extension.  (Epsilon for
Windows only.)

ŒT displays the Windows property page for the file.  (Epsilon for
Windows only.)

ŒF opens the folder containing this file in Explorer.  (Epsilon for

2quoted-insert

 Cquoted-insertquoted-insert–l rTake the next character literally.Ctrl-Q—

The command reads another key and inserts it into the buffer, even if
that key would not normally run ¬normal-character.  Nothing happens
if the key does not represent an 8-bit ASCII character.  Use this
command to insert control characters, meta characters, or graphics
characters into the buffer.

“quoted-insert

2read-session

 Cread-sessionread-sessionRestore files from the last session.

By default, Epsilon automatically restores the previous session (the
files you were editing, the window configuration, bookmarks, search
strings, and so forth) only when you start it without specifying a
file name on the command line.  This command restores the previous
session manually.  Reading in a session file rereads any files
mentioned in the session file, as well as replacing search strings,
all bookmarks, and the window configuration.  (If there are unsaved
files, Epsilon asks if you want to save them first.)  Any files not
mentioned in the session file will remain, as will keyboard macros,
key bindings, and most variable settings.

2rebuild-menu

 Crebuild-menurebuild-menuPut modified bindings into menu.

This command makes Epsilon reconstruct its menus, adding current key
bindings.

2record-kbd-macro

 Crecord-kbd-macrorecord-kbd-macro–l rStart or stop recording a macro.Brief: F7—

This command begins recording a keyboard macro.  Keys you press
execute normally, but also become part of an accumulating keyboard
macro.  Run this command again to finish defining the macro.

“record-kbd-macro

2redisplay

 CredisplayredisplayRewrite the entire screen.

Normally Epsilon does not write to the screen during the execution of
a keyboard macro.  This command forces a complete rewrite of the
screen.  Use it if you need to create a keyboard macro that updates
the screen in the middle of execution.

“redisplay

2redo

 Credoredo–l rRedo the last buffer change or movement.F10—

This command reverses the effect of the last undo command.  If
repeated, it restores earlier changes.  You may remove the changes
again with ¬undo.

“redo

2redo-changes

 Credo-changesredo-changes–l rRedo, skipping over movement redo's.Ctrl-F10—

This command operates like redo, except that it will
automatically redo all changes to the buffer that involve only
movements of point, and stop just before a change of actual buffer
contents.  When you invoke redo-changes, it performs a redo,
then continues to redo changes that consist only of movements of
point.

“redo-changes

2regex-replace

 Cregex-replaceregex-replace–l rSubstitute for replace expressions.Alt-*—

This command functions like query-replace, but starts in regular
expression mode.  Œ»pat1…|»pat2… matches either »pat1… or »pat2….

Œ»pat…* matches zero or more matches of »pat….

Œ»pat…+ matches one or more matches of »pat….

Œ»pat…? matches zero or one matches of »pat….

Œ[abx] matches any of the characters a, b, or x.

Œ[^abx] matches any but a, b, or x.

Œ[a-z3] matches a, b, c, ... z, or 3.

Œ. matches any character except newline.

Œ( ) group patterns for +, *, ?, and |.

Œ^ only matches at the beginning of a line.

Œ$ only matches at the end of a line.

Œ<#50> means the character with ASCII code 50.

Œ% removes the special meaning from the following character, so
that %$ matches only $.

Œ! marks the end of the match.  The command does not change any
characters that match the pattern after the exclamation point.



In the replacement text, #1 means substitute the part of the text
that matched the first parenthesized pattern piece.  For example,
using regex-replace to replace "([A-Z][a-z]+)([.!?])" with
"#2 ends #1" changes the text "Howard!" to "! ends Howard".
#0 means to substitute the whole match.

“regex-replace

2regex-search

 Cregex-searchregex-search–l rSearch for a string after point.Ctrl-Alt-S—

The command prompts for a regular expression, then positions point

message appears in the echo area.  Œ»pat1…|»pat2… matches either »pat1… or »pat2….

Œ»pat…* matches zero or more matches of »pat….

Œ»pat…+ matches one or more matches of »pat….

Œ»pat…? matches zero or one matches of »pat….

Œ[abx] matches any of the characters a, b, or x.

exists, a message appears in the echo area.

“reverse-regex-search

2reverse-replace

 Creverse-replacereverse-replaceInteractively replace strings, moving backward.

This command behaves like query-replace, but searches backward
through the buffer for text to replace, instead of forward.  It
positions point before each occurrence of the old string, and you may
select whether or not to replace it.  With a numeric argument, the
command will match only complete words.

This command asks for the name of a buffer and fills it with a copy
of the current buffer reverse sorted by lines.  If you specify a
numeric argument of ªnº, the command will ignore the first ªnº
columns on each line when comparing lines.

“reverse-sort-buffer

2reverse-sort-region

 Creverse-sort-regionreverse-sort-regionReverse sort part of the buffer in place.

This command reverse sorts in place the lines of the current buffer

the file.

“revert-file

2save-all-buffers

 Csave-all-bufferssave-all-buffers–l rSave every buffer that contains a file.Ctrl-X S—

This command will save all modified buffers except those that do not
have files associated with them.  If it encounters some sort of error
while saving the file, this command displays the error message, and
aborts any running keyboard macros.

“save-all-buffers

2save-file

 Csave-filesave-file–l rSave the buffer to its file.Ctrl-X Ctrl-S—

This command writes the contents of the current buffer to its file.
If the current buffer does not have an associated file, Epsilon asks
for a file name.  If it encounters some sort of problem (like no more
disk space), an appropriate error message appears in the echo area.
Otherwise, Epsilon displays the file name in the echo area.  To
explicitly write the contents of the buffer to a file whose name you
specify, use the write-file command.

“scroll-down

2scroll-left

 Cscroll-leftscroll-left–l rStop wrapping, then scroll the buffer contents to the left.Alt-{—

This command first causes Epsilon to scroll long lines.
Subsequently, it scrolls the buffer contents to the left by one
column.  If you prefix the command with a numeric argument, the
command enables scrolling, then scrolls the buffer contents that many
columns to the left.  The command adjusts point if necessary to stay
within the displayed section of the buffer.

 Cscroll-rightscroll-right–l rScroll the buffer contents to the right, or wrap lines.Alt-}—

This command scrolls the buffer contents to the right by one column,
if possible.  If not possible, this command causes Epsilon to switch
to wrapping long lines.  This command adjusts point if necessary to
stay within the displayed section of the buffer.

“scroll-right

2scroll-up

 Cscroll-upscroll-up–l rScroll the buffer contents up.Ctrl-Z—

This command scrolls the contents of the current window up by one
line, then adjusts point if necessary to keep it in the window.

“scroll-up

2search-again

 Csearch-againsearch-again–l rRepeat the last search in the same direction.Brief: Shift-F5—

This command searches again for the last text you searched for, in
the same direction as before.

“search-again

2search-all-help-files

 Csearch-all-help-filessearch-all-help-filesLook for a keyword in a list of help files.

This command searches for a keyword in any one of a list of help
files.  If you highlight a keyword first, Epsilon will look for help
on the highlighted text.  Otherwise, Epsilon will display a list of
possible keywords.

Before you can use this command, you should use the
select-help-files command to tell Epsilon which help files it
should search.  You can also edit the file epswhlp.cnt to modify the
list of help files.

This command is only available under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT
(3.51 and later).

“search-all-help-files

2select-buffer

 Cselect-bufferselect-buffer–l rDisplay a buffer in the current window.Ctrl-X B—

This command prompts for a buffer name.  If a buffer with that name
exists, the command connects it to the current window.  Otherwise, it
creates a buffer with the indicated name, and connects that to the
current window.  If you just press ⁄Enter€ to the prompt for a
buffer, it defaults to the last buffer associated with the current
window.  So, repeated Ctrl-X B's will generally switch back and forth
between two buffers.

“select-buffer

2select-help-files

 Cselect-help-filesselect-help-filesAdd installed help files to Epsilon's menu.

You can set up Epsilon for Windows to search for help on a
programming language construct (like an API function or a C++
keyword) in a series of help files.  First use this command to look
for some common help files that may be on your disk.  It will prompt
for a list of drive letters, then show you the help files it found.

After you have an opportunity to edit the list of help files, the
command then adds the help files to Epsilon's Help menu, to the
context menu that the secondary mouse button displays, and to the
list of files searched by the search-all-help-files command on
the Help menu.  Edit the file gui.mnu to further modify the contents
of Epsilon's menus.

When you select a help file from the menu after running this command,
Epsilon will open that help file.  If you highlight a keyword first,
Epsilon will look for help on the highlighted text.  Otherwise,
Epsilon will display the help file's table of contents or a list of
keywords.  (See the
¬winhelp-display-contents≈winhelp-display-contents variable for
details.)

“select-help-files

2select-tag-file

 Cselect-tag-fileselect-tag-file–l rChange to a different tag file.Ctrl-X Alt-,—

This command prompts for a file name, then starts using the tags in
that file instead of the ones in the current tag file.

“select-tag-file

2set-abort-key

 Cset-abort-keyset-abort-keySpecify the key which interrupts commands.

You can set the abort key with the set-abort-key command.
Pressing the abort key cancels any currently executing keyboard
macros.  If you interrupt Epsilon while reading a file from disk or
writing a file to disk, it will ask you whether you want to abort or
continue.  You must set the abort key to an unprefixed key.

“set-abort-key

2set-any-variable

 Cset-any-variableset-any-variableSet even dangerous variables.

Like set-variable, this command prompts for the name of a
variable, then for a new value.  Unlike set-variable, however,
this command lets you set even those internal variables that may
produce unexpected or undesired side-effects if you set them.

“set-any-variable

2set-bookmark

 Cset-bookmarkset-bookmark–l rRemember the current editing position.Alt-/—

This command remembers the current buffer and position, so that you
can easily return to it later with jump-to-last-bookmark.
Epsilon stores the last 10 bookmarks that you set with this command.
See also set-named-bookmark and jump-to-named-bookmark.

“set-bookmark

2set-color

 Cset-colorset-colorSelect new screen colors.

This command displays a map of possible screen color combinations.
By moving the cursor, you may select a color for each element on the
screen, called a color class.  The N and P keys change from one color
class to the next (or previous), and the arrow keys change the color
of the currently-selected color class.

Epsilon has several pre-configured sets of color classes.  These are
known as color schemes.  Use the F and B keys to select a color
scheme.  You can then fine-tune it using the above commands.  Or you
can press D to define a brand-new color scheme based on the current
one.

Once you've selected colors, you can make them permanent for the
current editing session by pressing the S key.  (Use the
write-state command to save the changes for future editing
sessions.)  Or you can press T to try out the colors in a recursive
editing session.  Run the exit-level command on Ctrl-x Ctrl-z to
return to setting colors.  If you decide you don't like the colors,
you can cancel all your changes by pressing C.

You can use the mouse to select colors, too.  Click on a name to
select a color scheme or color class.  Click on a color to select it.
Click on the capital letters in the help window to run those commands
(like S to set).

In Epsilon for Unix, when running as an X window manager program, the
set-color command is not used for setting colors, only for
selecting a particular color scheme.  To set colors in this version,
edit an EEL file like mycolors.e.  Epsilon's default color schemes
are defined in the file stdcolor.e.

Epsilon lets you choose one color scheme for non-GUI color displays,
one for non-GUI mono displays, and one for the GUI version, and
remembers each choice separately.  Using set-color to pick a
different color scheme only affects one of the three.

“set-color

2set-comment-column

 Cset-comment-columnset-comment-column–l rSpecify where comments go.Ctrl-X ;—

This command set the value of the comment-column variable to the
current column.  With a positive argument, it sets the variable based
on the indentation of the previous comment in the buffer.  In that
case, it also reindents any comment on the line.

With a negative argument, it doesn't change the comment column, but
runs the kill-comment command to remove the line's comment.

“set-comment-column

2set-debug

 Cset-debugset-debugEnable or disable single-stepping for a command or subroutine.

This command prompts you for the name of a command or subroutine,
with completion.  With no numeric argument, this command toggles the
debugging status for that function.  With a non-zero numeric
argument, the command enables the debugging status.  With a zero
numeric argument, it disables the debugging status.

Whenever Epsilon calls a function with debugging enabled, the Epsilon
debugger starts, and displays the function's source code at the
bottom of the screen.  A ⁄Space€ executes the next line of the
function, a G turns off debugging until the function returns, and ?
shows all the debugger's commands.  If you compile a function with
the system switch (eel -s »filename…), you cannot use the debugger on
it.

“set-debug

2set-dialog-font

 Cset-dialog-fontset-dialog-fontSelect the font to use in Epsilon dialogs.

Use this command to select the font Epsilon uses in dialog windows
(like the one bufed displays).  It sets the variable
font-dialog.

“set-dialog-font

2set-display-characters

 Cset-display-charactersset-display-charactersSelect new screen characters.

The set-display-characters command lets you alter the various
characters that Epsilon uses to construct its display.  The command
displays a matrix of possible characters, and guides you through the
selection process.

The first group specifies which graphic characters Epsilon should use
to draw window borders.  It defines all the line-drawing characters
needed for drawing four different styles of borders, and all possible
intersections of these.

The next group specifies which characters Epsilon uses to display
various special characters like ⁄Tab€ or Control-E.  For example,
Epsilon usually displays a control character with the ^ symbol.
Set the appropriate character in this group to make Epsilon use a
different character.  You can also make Epsilon display a special
character at the end of each line, or change the continuation
character.

The following group defines the characters Epsilon uses to display
window scroll bars.  Epsilon replaces the window's selected border
characters with characters from this group.

Epsilon uses the last group for its graphical mouse cursor.  When
Epsilon for DOS uses a graphical mouse cursor, it must redefine the
appearance of nine characters.  By default, Epsilon uses nine
non-ASCII graphic characters, including some math symbols and some
block graphic characters.  Set the characters in this group to alter
the reserved characters Epsilon uses.  As you move the mouse around,
the appearance of these characters will change.  If you edit a binary
file with these characters in single-character graphic mode (where
Epsilon displays the IBM graphic characters for control and meta
characters), you may wish to use a block mouse cursor by setting
mouse-graphic-cursor to 0, or starting with the -kc1 flag.

“set-display-characters

2set-display-look

 Cset-display-lookset-display-lookMake the screen look like another editor.

This command makes Epsilon's window decoration and screen appearance
resemble that of some other editor.  It displays a menu of choices.
You can select Epsilon's original look, Brief's look, the look of the
DOS Edit program (which is the same as the QBasic program), or the
look of Borland's IDE.

“set-display-look

2set-file-name

 Cset-file-nameset-file-name–l rChange the file name associated with this buffer.Brief: Alt-O—

This command prompts for a new file name for the current buffer, and
changes the file name associated with the buffer.  The next time you
save the file, Epsilon will save it under the new name.

“set-file-name

2set-fill-column

 Cset-fill-columnset-fill-column–l rSet the column at which filling occurs.Ctrl-X F—

If you provide a numeric argument, the command sets the fill column
for the current buffer to that value.  Otherwise, the command prompts
you for a new fill column, with the point's column offered as a
default.  The fill column controls what auto fill mode and the
filling commands consider the right margin.

To set the default value for new buffers you create, use the
set-variable command on F8 to set the default value of the
margin-right variable.

“set-fill-column

2set-font

 Cset-fontset-fontSelect a different font.

This command changes the font Epsilon uses, by displaying a font
dialog box and letting you pick a new font.  It's available under
Windows and X.

“set-font

2set-line-translate

 Cset-line-translateset-line-translateSpecify Epsilon's line translation scheme.

The operating system uses the sequence of characters Return Newline
to indicate the end of a line.  Epsilon normally changes this
sequence to a single Newline when it reads in a file (by removing all
the Return characters).  When it writes a file, it adds a Return
before each Newline character.

Epsilon automatically selects one of several other translation types
when appropriate, based on the contents of the file you edit (regular
text, binary, Unix, or Macintosh).  You can explicitly override this
if Epsilon guesses wrong by providing a numeric argument to a file
reading command like find-file.  Epsilon will then prompt for
which translation scheme to use.

This command sets the desired translation method for the current
buffer.  It prompts for the desired type of translation, and makes
future file reads and writes in this buffer use that translation.
Epsilon will display "Binary", "Unix", "DOS", or "Mac" in the
mode line to indicate any special translation in effect.

“set-line-translate

2set-mark

 Cset-markset-mark–l rSet the mark to the current position.Ctrl-@—

Commands that operate on a region of the buffer use the mark and
point to delimit the region.  This command sets the mark to the
current value of point.

“set-mark

2set-named-bookmark

 Cset-named-bookmarkset-named-bookmark–l rName the current editing position.Ctrl-X /—

This command prompts you for a letter, then associates that letter
with a bookmark at the current location.  Subsequently, you can
return to that location with the jump-to-named-bookmark command.
If you provide a digit instead of a letter, Epsilon sets the
appropriate temporary bookmark (0 refers to the last one, 1 to the
one before that, and so on).  You can press "?" to get a list of the
currently defined bookmarks, along with the text that contains the
bookmarks.  To select one, simply move to the desired bookmark and
press ⁄Enter€.

See also set-bookmark and jump-to-last-bookmark.

“set-named-bookmark

2set-printer-font

 Cset-printer-fontset-printer-fontSelect the font to use when printing.

Use this command to select the font Epsilon uses when printing.  It
sets the variable font-printer.

“set-printer-font

2set-show-graphic

 Cset-show-graphicset-show-graphicEnable or disable use of IBM graphic characters.

By default, Epsilon displays most control characters by prefixing to
them a caret, e.g., Control C appears as "^C".  It displays other
characters, including international characters, with their graphic
symbol.  Epsilon has four different modes for displaying all these
characters.

In mode 0, Epsilon displays Meta characters (characters with the 8th
bit on) by prefixing to them a "M-", e.g., Meta C appears as
"M-C".  Epsilon display Control-meta characters by prefixing to
them "M-^", e.g., "M-^C".  Epsilon displays most control
characters by prefixing to them a caret, e.g., Control C appears as
"^C".

In mode 1, all-graphic mode, Epsilon uses graphic characters to
display all control characters and meta characters (except for the
few that have a special meaning, like ⁄Tab€ or ⁄Newline€).

In mode 2, hex mode, Epsilon displays control and meta characters by
their hexadecimal ASCII values, with an "x" before them to indicate
hex.

In mode 3, which is the default, Epsilon displays control characters
as "^C", and uses the graphic symbol for other characters, as
described above.

If you provide no numeric argument, this command cycles to the next
mode in the above list.  A numeric argument of 0, 1, 2, or 3 selects
the corresponding mode.

“set-show-graphic

2set-tab-size

 Cset-tab-sizeset-tab-sizeSet how many columns are between tab settings.

This command sets the number of spaces between tab stops for the
current buffer.  If given a numeric argument, Epsilon sets the tab
size to that number.  Otherwise the command prompts for the tab size.
By default, Epsilon puts tab settings every 8 columns.  Some language
modes like C mode default to a different setting; see
c-tab-override and similarly-named variables.

“set-tab-size

2set-variable

 Cset-variableset-variable–l rSet any EEL variable.F8—

This command prompts for the name of a variable and a new value for
that variable.  This command cannot set variables with complicated
types involving structures or pointers.  After setting the variable,
Epsilon shows the new value using show-variable.

If you specify a buffer-specific or window-specific variable, Epsilon
uses the numeric argument to determine whether to set the value for
the current buffer or window (zero numeric argument), the default
value (negative numeric argument), or both (positive numeric
argument).  If you provide no numeric argument, Epsilon asks which of
these values to set.

“set-variable

2set-video

 Cset-videoset-video–l rChange to a particular number of lines or columns.Alt-F5—

This command asks for a screen mode of the form 80x25, then tries to
put the display in that mode.  Typing ? shows the available
modes.  (DOS, OS/2 only)

“set-video

2set-want-backup-file

 Cset-want-backup-fileset-want-backup-file–l rTurn backup files on or off in this buffer.Brief: Ctrl-W—

This command toggles whether or not Epsilon makes a backup file each
time you save the current buffer.

“set-want-backup-file

2shell-mode

 Cshell-modeshell-modeSet up for editing shell scripts.

This command puts the current buffer in a mode suitable for editing
Unix shell scripts and similar files.

“shell-mode

2show-bindings

 Cshow-bindingsshow-bindings–l rFind a key bound to a command.F5, F1 B—

The command prompts for a command name, then displays a message
telling which keys, if any, run that command.

“show-bindings

2show-connections

 Cshow-connectionsshow-connections–l rShow all Internet connection buffers.Ctrl-Alt-C—

This command lists all active Telnet, FTP, and similar Internet
activities and buffers.  You can select a buffer and press ⁄Enter€ to
switch to it, or press ⁄Escape€ to remain in the current buffer.

“show-connections

2show-last-keys

 Cshow-last-keysshow-last-keys–l rDisplay recently typed keys.F1 L—

This command pops up a window that displays the last 60 keystrokes
you typed.

“show-last-keys

2show-matching-delimiter

 Cshow-matching-delimitershow-matching-delimiterInsert character and show match.

This command first invokes normal-character to insert the key
that invoked it, then shows the delimiter character matching this one
using find-delimiter.  Some people like to bind this command to
keys such as ")" or "}".

“show-matching-delimiter

2show-menu

 Cshow-menushow-menu–l rDisplay a menu of commands.Alt-F2—

This command displays a menu of commands and lets you choose one.
Use the arrow keys to navigate through the menu.  Letter keys move to
the next command in the current column beginning with that letter.
Press ⁄Enter€ to execute the highlighted command, or click on a
command with the mouse.  Press Ctrl-G or ⁄Esc€ to exit from the menu.

“show-menu

2show-point

 Cshow-pointshow-point–l rShow information about point.Ctrl-X =—

This command displays the column number, value of point, and size of
the buffer, as well as the ASCII, decimal, and hex codes of the
character after point.  The file will probably occupy more space on
disk than the buffer size indicates, due to the line translation
scheme that Epsilon uses when reading and writing files.  Use the
count-lines command, bound to Ctrl-X L, to get the exact number
of bytes the buffer would occupy on disk.

“show-point

2show-standard-bitmaps

 Cshow-standard-bitmapsshow-standard-bitmapsDisplay available icons for the tool bar.

You can use this function to see some of the icons that may appear on
Epsilon's tool bar (Windows 95/98, NT only).  It's useful when
modifying the contents of the tool bar.

“show-standard-bitmaps

2show-variable

 Cshow-variableshow-variable–l rDisplay the value of an EEL variable.Ctrl-F8—

This command prompts for the name of a variable and displays its
value in the echo area.  This command cannot show variables with
complicated types involving structures or pointers.  If the variable
can have a different value for each buffer or window (buffer-specific
or window-specific), this command uses its numeric argument or asks
the user in the same fashion as set-variable.

“show-variable

2show-version

 Cshow-versionshow-version–l rDisplay Epsilon's version number.F1 V—

This command displays Epsilon's version number in the echo area.
Epsilon automatically invokes this command at startup.

2show-view-bitmaps

 Cshow-view-bitmapsshow-view-bitmapsDisplay available icons for the tool bar.

You can use this function to see some of the icons that may appear on
Epsilon's tool bar (Windows 95/98, NT only).  It's useful when
modifying the contents of the tool bar.

“show-view-bitmaps

2shrink-window

 Cshrink-windowshrink-window–l rShrink the current window by one line.Ctrl-⁄PgDn€—

If possible, the mode line of the window on top of the current window
moves down.  Otherwise, the current window's mode line moves up.
This command has no effect if it would make the current window
smaller than two lines, counting the mode line.

“shrink-window

2shrink-window-horizontally

 Cshrink-window-horizontallyshrink-window-horizontally–l rShrink the current window by one column.Alt-⁄PgDn€—

If possible, the left boundary of the current window moves to the
right by one column.  Otherwise, the right boundary moves to the left
by one column.  This command has no effect if it would make the
window smaller than one character wide.

“shrink-window-horizontally

2shrink-window-interactively

 Cshrink-window-interactivelyshrink-window-interactively–l rUse arrow keys to resize a window.Ctrl-X -—

This command lets you interactively change the size of the current
window.  After you invoke the command, use the arrow keys to point to
a window border.  The indicated border moves in a direction so as to
make the current window smaller.  Keep pressing arrow keys to move
window borders.  To switch from shrinking to enlarging, press the
minus key.  Thereafter, the arrow keys cause the window border to
move in a direction so as to enlarge the window.  When the window
looks right, press ⁄Enter€ to leave the command.

“shrink-window-interactively

2sort-buffer

 Csort-buffersort-bufferSort the current buffer.

This command asks for the name of a buffer and fills it with a copy
of the current buffer sorted by lines.  If you specify a numeric
argument of ªnº, the command will compare lines starting at column
ªnº.

“sort-buffer

2sort-region

 Csort-regionsort-regionSort part of the buffer in place.

This command sorts in place the lines of the current buffer appearing
between point and mark.  If you specify a numeric argument of ªnº,
the command will ignore the first ªnº columns on each line when
comparing lines.

“sort-region

2sort-tags

 Csort-tagssort-tagsSort the list of tags manually.

By default, Epsilon sorts the tag list whenever it needs to display a
list of tag names for you to choose from.  Instead, you can set the
want-sorted-tags variable to 0, and sort the tags manually,
whenever you want, using this command.

“sort-tags

2split-window

 Csplit-windowsplit-window–l rSplit the current window in two.Ctrl-X 2—

This command splits the current window into two windows, one on top
of the other, occupying the same total space.  Nothing happens if
either resulting window would have fewer than two lines of height
(counting the mode line).

“split-window

2split-window-vertically

 Csplit-window-verticallysplit-window-vertically–l rSplit the current window in two.Ctrl-X 5—

This command splits the current window into two windows, one beside
the other, occupying the same total space.  Nothing happens if either
resulting window would have fewer than one character of width.

“split-window-vertically

2standard-toolbar

 Cstandard-toolbarstandard-toolbarDisplay Epsilon's normal tool bar.

Epsilon calls this function to display its tool bar (Windows 95/98,
NT only).  By redefining the function, you can change what appears on
the tool bar.

“standard-toolbar

2start-kbd-macro

 Cstart-kbd-macrostart-kbd-macro–l rStart defining a keyboard macro.Ctrl-X (—

After you invoke this command, everything you type executes normally,
but it also becomes part of an accumulating keyboard macro.  The
macro definition ends when you invoke the end-kbd-macro command.

“start-kbd-macro

2start-process

 Cstart-processstart-process–l rInvoke a concurrent command processor.Ctrl-X Ctrl-M—

You can create a concurrent subprocess with Epsilon.  The
start-process command shows the "Process" buffer in the current
window, and starts a command processor running in it.  Epsilon will
capture the output of commands that you run in the window, and insert
that output into the process buffer.  When the process reads input
from its standard input, Epsilon will give it the characters that you
insert at the end of the buffer.  You can move to other windows or
buffers and issue Epsilon commands during the execution of a
concurrent process.

With a numeric argument, the start-process command will prompt
for a command line, and will pass that line to the command processor
to do just that command.  The stop-process command will stop a
running program, just as Ctrl-C would outside of Epsilon.  Under DOS,
the stop-process command will not take effect until the program's
next DOS call, exclusive of console input or output.  You may
generate an end-of-file for a program reading from the standard input
by inserting a Control-Z (quoted with Ctrl-Q) on a line by itself, at
the end of the buffer.

Programs invoked with this command should not do any cursor
positioning or graphics.  We provide the concurrent process facility
primarily to let you run programs like compilers, linkers,
assemblers, filters, etc.

Epsilon will let you run only one other program at a time.  If you
exit Epsilon with a concurrent process running, Epsilon kills the
concurrent process, except under DOS.  In the DOS version, you cannot
have a program running concurrently when you exit Epsilon.  To stop a
command processor, use the command "exit".  Epsilon will then say
"Exited", and you can leave Epsilon, or start another process.

“start-process

2stop-process

 Cstop-processstop-process–l rAbort the concurrent process.Ctrl-C—

For DOS, this command makes a concurrent process (see
start-process) believe that you typed Control-Break.  You cannot
stop in this manner programs which do no DOS calls other than console
input or output.  With a numeric argument, however, the command stops
the process in a different way, and can stop any program but causes
some (including early versions of the command processor) to crash the
system.  Use this command with a numeric argument only after you've
tried it without one.

In other environments, this command makes a concurrent process
believe you typed Control-Break (or, for Unix, the interrupt key), as
in DOS, but without the restrictions and complications described
above.

“stop-process

2string-search

 Cstring-searchstring-searchStart a search in non-incremental mode.

This command starts a search in non-incremental mode.  It works like
starting an incremental search with the incremental-search
command, then disabling incremental mode with Ctrl-O.

“string-search

2suspend-epsilon

 Csuspend-epsilonsuspend-epsilonSuspend or minimize Epsilon for Unix.

This command suspends Epsilon for Unix, returning control to the
shell that launched it.  Use the shell's fg command to resume
Epsilon.  When Epsilon runs as an X program, it instead minimizes
Epsilon's window.

“suspend-epsilon

2switch-windows

 Cswitch-windowsswitch-windows–l rSwitch to the next or previous window.Ctrl-⁄Tab€—

This command switches to the next window.  Hold down shift while
pressing its key, and it will switch to the previous window.

“switch-windows

2tabify-buffer

 Ctabify-buffertabify-bufferReplace spaces in buffer with the right number of tabs.

This command removes all sequences of spaces and tabs throughout the
buffer.  In their place, it inserts a sequence of tabs followed by a
sequence of spaces to reach the same column that the prior whitespace
did.

“tabify-buffer

2tabify-region

 Ctabify-regiontabify-region–l rConvert whitespace to tabs.Ctrl-X Ctrl-Alt-I—

Between point and mark, this command removes all sequences of spaces
and tabs.  In their place, it inserts a sequence of tabs followed by
a sequence of spaces to reach the same column that the prior
whitespace did.

“tabify-region

2tag-files

 Ctag-filestag-files–l rLocate all tags in the given files.Ctrl-X Alt-.—

This command prompts for a file name or file pattern.  In each file,
it locates each subroutine or function and makes a tag for it, so
commands like goto-tag can find it later.  You can use extended
file patterns to tag files in multiple directories.

With a prefix numeric argument, this command tags function
declarations as well as function definitions, and external variable
declarations as well as variable definitions.  Use a numeric argument
if you have an #include file for a package but no source file,
and you want tag references to a function in the package to go to the
#include file.

2telnet

 CtelnettelnetConnect to a remote computer and run a shell.

The telnet command lets you connect to a command shell on a remote
computer.  It puts you in a buffer that works much like the Epsilon
process buffer, except the commands you type are executed on the
remote machine.  Provide a numeric prefix argument and telnet will
connect on the specified port instead of the default port.  You can
either use the telnet command directly, or specify a telnet: URL
to find-file.  (Epsilon ignores any username or password included
in the URL.)

“telnet

2telnet-mode

 Ctelnet-modetelnet-modeConnect to a remote computer and send commands.

In Telnet mode, the key Ctrl-C immediately sends an interrupt signal
to the remote machine, and Ctrl-O immediately sends a Ctrl-O
character (which typically makes the remote machine discard pending
output).

“telnet-mode

2tex-boldface

 Ctex-boldfacetex-boldface–l rMake boldface text in TeX mode.TeX mode: Alt-Shift-B—

This command inserts the TeX command to make a section of text bold.

text bold, or you can use the command and then type the text to be
bold.

“tex-boldface

2tex-center-line

 Ctex-center-linetex-center-line–l rCreate a centered line of text in TeX mode.TeX mode: Alt-S—

This command inserts the TeX or LaTeX command to center a line of
text.  (See the variable tex-force-latex.)

“tex-center-line

2tex-display-math

 Ctex-display-mathtex-display-math–l rInsert ¥] when you type ¥[.TeX mode: ¥[—

When you type ¥[, this command inserts ¥] for you.

“tex-display-math

2tex-environment

 Ctex-environmenttex-environment–l rCreate the specified LaTeX environment.TeX mode: Alt-Shift-E—

This command prompts for the name of a LaTeX environment, then
inserts LaTeX ¥beginµ»env…∂ and ¥endµ»env…∂ commands for that
environment.  You can highlight a block of text first and Epsilon
will put the environment commands around it, or you can run this
command and then type the text to go in that environment.  Press ? to
select an environment from a list.  (The list of environments comes
from the file latex.env, which you can edit.)

“tex-environment

2tex-footnote

 Ctex-footnotetex-footnote–l rMake a footnote in TeX mode.TeX mode: Alt-Shift-F—

This command inserts the TeX command to mark a section of text as a
footnote.  You can highlight a block of text first and Epsilon will
make it a footnote, or you can use the command and then type the
footnote.

“tex-footnote

2tex-force-quote

 Ctex-force-quotetex-force-quote–l rInsert a " character.TeX mode: Alt-"—

This command inserts a true " character.  Normally typing "
itself inserts either a `` or a '' sequence.

“tex-force-quote

2tex-inline-math

 Ctex-inline-mathtex-inline-math–l rInsert ¥) when you type ¥(.TeX mode: ¥(—

When you type ¥(, this command inserts ¥) for you.

“tex-inline-math

2tex-italic

 Ctex-italictex-italic–l rMake italic text in TeX mode.TeX mode: Alt-i—

This command inserts the TeX command to make a section of text
italic.  You can highlight a block of text first and Epsilon will
make the text italic, or you can use the command and then type the
italic text.

“tex-italic

2tex-left-brace

 Ctex-left-bracetex-left-brace–l rInsert ∂ when you type µ.TeX mode: µ—

This command inserts a matched pair of braces.  After a ¥ character,
it inserts a ¥ before the closing brace.  But if you type this key
just before a non-whitespace character, it inserts only a µ.  This
makes it easier to surround existing text with braces.

“tex-left-brace

2tex-math-escape

 Ctex-math-escapetex-math-escape–l rInsert $ when you type $.TeX mode: $—

This command inserts a matched pair of $ characters (except after a ¥
character).

“tex-math-escape

2tex-mode

 Ctex-modetex-modeSet up for editing TeX or LaTeX documents.

This command sets up Epsilon for editing TeX or LaTeX documents.
Keys in TeX mode include Alt-i for italic text, Alt-Shift-I for
slanted text, Alt-Shift-T for typewriter, Alt-Shift-B for boldface,
Alt-Shift-C for small caps, Alt-Shift-F for a footnote, and Alt-s for
a centered line.  Alt-Shift-E prompts for the name of a LaTeX
environment, then inserts ¥beginµ»env…∂ and ¥endµ»env…∂ lines.

For all these commands, you can highlight a block of text first and
Epsilon will make the text italic, slanted, etc. or you can use the
command and then type the text to be italic, slanted, etc.

The keys "µ" and "$" insert matched pairs of characters (either µ∂ or
$$), the keys ⁄Comma€ and ⁄Period€ remove a preceding italic
correction ¥/, the " key inserts the appropriate kind of
doublequote sequence like `` or '', and Alt-" inserts an
actual " character.

“tex-mode

2tex-quote

 Ctex-quotetex-quote–l rInsert the right TeX doublequote sequence.TeX mode: "—

This command inserts the appropriate doublequote sequence like ``
or '', based on the preceding characters.  Alt-" inserts an
actual " character.

“tex-quote

2tex-rm-correction

 Ctex-rm-correctiontex-rm-correction–l rRemove an italic correction.TeX mode: ⁄Comma€, ⁄Dot€—

2tex-slant

 Ctex-slanttex-slant–l rMake slanted text in TeX mode.TeX mode: Alt-Shift-I—

This command inserts the TeX command to make a section of text
slanted.  You can highlight a block of text first and Epsilon will
make the text slanted, or you can use the command and then type the
text to be slanted.

“tex-slant

2tex-small-caps

 Ctex-small-capstex-small-caps–l rMake small caps text in TeX mode.TeX mode: Alt-Shift-C—

This command inserts the TeX command to set a section of text in
small caps.  You can highlight a block of text first and Epsilon will
put the text in small caps, or you can use the command and then type
the text.

“tex-small-caps

2tex-typewriter

 Ctex-typewritertex-typewriter–l rUse a typewriter font in TeX mode.TeX mode: Alt-Shift-T—

This command inserts the TeX command to set a section of text in a
typewriter font.  You can highlight a block of text first and Epsilon
will set that text in a typewriter font, or you can use the command
and then type the text.

“tex-typewriter

2to-indentation

 Cto-indentationto-indentation–l rMove point to the end of the indentation.Alt-M—

This command positions point before the first non-whitespace
character in the line.

“to-indentation

2to-left-edge

 Cto-left-edgeto-left-edge–l rMove to the left edge of the window.Brief: Shift-⁄Home€—

This command moves point to the left edge of the current window.

“to-left-edge

2to-right-edge

 Cto-right-edgeto-right-edge–l rMove to the right edge of the window.Brief: Shift-⁄End€—

This command moves point to the right edge of the current window.

“to-right-edge

2toggle-borders

 Ctoggle-borderstoggle-borders–l rRemove borders around windows, use color to distinguish them.Brief: Alt-F1—

This command removes the borders around ordinary tiled windows,
letting the text regions occupy more of the screen.  If the windows
have no borders already, this command restores them.  When this
command reenables borders, it does so according to the settings of
the variables border-left, border-top, and so forth.  Epsilon
displays a border only if the appropriate variable has been set, and
toggle-borders hasn't disabled all borders.

When there are no window borders, Epsilon provides each window with
its own separate color scheme, in place of the single one selected by
¬set-color.  (You can still use ¬set-color to set the individual
colors in a color scheme, but Epsilon doesn't care which particular
color scheme you select when it displays the contents of individual
windows.  It does use the selected color scheme for other parts of
the screen like the echo area or screen border.)

The color schemes Epsilon uses for borderless windows have names like
"window-black", "window-blue" and so forth.  Epsilon assigns them
to windows in the same order they appear in set-color.  You can
remove one from consideration using the ¬delete-name command, or
create a new one using ¬set-color (give it a name starting with
"window-").

“toggle-borders

2toggle-menu-bar

 Ctoggle-menu-bartoggle-menu-barToggle whether a permanent menu bar appears.

Add a menu bar at the top of the screen, moving windows down one
line.  If Epsilon already displays a menu bar, remove it.

“toggle-menu-bar

2toggle-scroll-bar

 Ctoggle-scroll-bartoggle-scroll-barToggle whether tiled windows have permanent scroll bars.

Put a scroll bar on the right edge of all tiled windows.  If tiled
windows already have scroll bars, remove them.

“toggle-scroll-bar

2toggle-toolbar

 Ctoggle-toolbartoggle-toolbarTurn the tool bar on or off.

Under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT (3.51 or later), Epsilon for
Windows can display a tool bar.  Position the mouse over a tool bar
button for a moment and Epsilon will describe what it does.  This
command hides or displays the tool bar.

“toggle-toolbar

2transpose-characters

 Ctranspose-characterstranspose-characters–l rSwap the characters around point.Ctrl-T—

At the end of a line, the command switches the two previous
characters.  At the beginning of a line, it switches the following
two characters.  Otherwise, it switches the characters before and
after point.  If the current line has less than two characters,
however, nothing happens.  Point never changes.

“transpose-characters

2transpose-lines

 Ctranspose-linestranspose-lines–l rSwap the current and previous lines.Ctrl-X Ctrl-T—

After the exchange, the command positions point between the two lines.

“transpose-lines

2transpose-words

 Ctranspose-wordstranspose-words–l rSwap the current and previous words.Alt-T—

The command leaves untouched the text between the words.  After the
exchange, the command positions point between the two words.

2tutorial

 CtutorialtutorialThis command shows Epsilon's tutorial.

“tutorial

2unbind-key

 Cunbind-keyunbind-keyRemove the binding from a key.

This command prompts for a key, then removes the binding of that key.

“unbind-key

2undo

 Cundoundo–l rUndo the last buffer change or movement.F9—

This command undoes the last change you made to the buffer.  If
repeated, it undoes earlier changes.  You may reinstate the changes
with redo.

“undo

2undo-changes

 Cundo-changesundo-changes–l rUndo, skipping over movement redo's.Ctrl-F9—

This command operates like undo, except that it will
automatically undo all changes to the buffer that involve only
movements of point, and stop just before a change of actual buffer
contents.  When you invoke undo-changes, it performs an undo,
then continues to undo changes that consist only of movements to
point.

“undo-changes

2uniq

 CuniquniqRemove extra copies of duplicate lines.

The command goes through the current buffer and looks for adjacent
identical lines, deleting the duplicate copies of each repeated line
and leaving just one.  It doesn't modify any lines that only occur
once.  Also see the keep-unique-lines and
keep-duplicate-lines command.

“uniq

2untabify-buffer

 Cuntabify-bufferuntabify-bufferReplace tabs in the buffer with spaces.

This command replaces each tab in the buffer by the number of spaces
required to fill the same number of columns.

“untabify-buffer

2untabify-region

 Cuntabify-regionuntabify-region–l rConvert tabs to spaces between point and mark.Ctrl-X Alt-I—

This command replaces each tab between point and mark by the number
of spaces required to fill the same number of columns.

“untabify-region

2untag-files

 Cuntag-filesuntag-filesDiscard tags for one or more files.

This command constructs a list of all files represented in the
current tag file.  You can edit the list in a recursive edit. When
you exit the recursive edit with the exit-level command on Ctrl-X
Ctrl-Z, any files you've removed from the list will be untagged.

“untag-files

2up-line

 Cup-lineup-line–l rPoint moves to the previous line.Ctrl-P—

The command tries to keep point near the same horizontal position.

“up-line

2uppercase-word

 Cuppercase-worduppercase-word–l rMake the current word upper case.Alt-U—

Point travels forward through the buffer as with forward-word,
changing all the letters it encounters to upper case.  If the current
buffer contains a highlighted region, Epsilon instead changes all the
letters in the region to upper case, leaving point unchanged.

“uppercase-word

2view-lugaru-web-site

 Cview-lugaru-web-siteview-lugaru-web-siteConnect to Lugaru's web site.

This command starts your web browser and points it to Lugaru's web
site.  It only works under Epsilon for Windows, on systems with more
recent web browsers.

“view-lugaru-web-site

2view-process

 Cview-processview-process–l rPop up a window of process output; pick an error msg.Shift-F3—

This command pops up a window showing the process buffer, including
all compiler command lines and any resulting error messages.  You can
move to any line and press ⁄Enter€, and Epsilon will immediately
locate the error message on the current line (or a following line)
and move to the file and line number in error.

“view-process

2visit-file

 Cvisit-filevisit-file–l rRead a file into the current buffer.Ctrl-X Ctrl-V—

This command prompts for a file name, then reads that file into the
current buffer, and positions point to the beginning.  If no file
with the given name exists, it creates a blank buffer.  In either
case, the command discards the old buffer contents.

Before discarding modified buffers, the command asks if you want to
save the current buffer contents.  With a numeric argument, it asks
no questions.  This comes in handy for reverting the buffer to the
contents of its file.

“visit-file

2visual-diff

 Cvisual-diffvisual-diffUse color-coding to compare two buffers.

The visual-diff command is like the diff command but uses
colors to show differences.  It compares the current buffer with the
one shown in the next window on the screen, and constructs a new
buffer that contains all the lines of the two buffers.  Lines from
the first buffer that don't appear in the second are displayed with a
red background.  Lines in the second buffer that don't appear in the
first have a yellow background.  Lines that are the same in both
buffers are colored normally.

“visual-diff

2visual-diff-mode

 Cvisual-diff-modevisual-diff-modeUse color-coding to compare two buffers.

The visual-diff command creates a buffer in visual diff mode that
shows the changes between one buffer and another.  Added lines are
shown with a yellow background, deleted lines are shown with a red
background, and common lines are colored as in the original buffers.

In a visual-diff buffer, the keys Alt-⁄Down€ and Alt-] move to the
start of the next changed or common section.  The keys Alt-⁄Up€ and
Alt-[ move to the previous one.

“visual-diff-mode

2wall-chart

 Cwall-chartwall-chartMake a chart of the current key bindings.

This command creates a wall chart consisting of all bound keys and
their current bindings.  You can print it using the print-buffer
command.

“wall-chart

2what-is

 Cwhat-iswhat-is–l rFind a command bound to a key.F6, F1 Q—

The command prompts for a key, then displays a message telling what
command runs when you press that key.

“what-is

2widen-buffer

 Cwiden-bufferwiden-bufferRestore normal access to the current buffer.

This command gives you normal access to the buffer.  Use it after a
¬narrow-to-region command to cancel the effect of that command.

“widen-buffer

2write-file

 Cwrite-filewrite-file–l rWrite the buffer to a file.Ctrl-X Ctrl-W—

This command prompts for a file name, then writes the buffer to a
file with that name.  The file associated with the current buffer
becomes that file, so subsequent uses of the ¬save-file command
will write the buffer to that file without asking for a file name.
See also copy-to-file and save-file.

“write-file

2write-files-and-exit

 Cwrite-files-and-exitwrite-files-and-exit–l rSave modified files, then leave Epsilon.Brief: Ctrl-X—

This command saves all modified buffers except those that do not have
files associated with them.  If there are no errors, it then exits
Epsilon.

“write-files-and-exit

2write-region

 Cwrite-regionwrite-region–l rWrite the region to the specified file.Ctrl-X W—

The command prompts for a file name, then writes the characters
between point and mark to that file.

“write-region

2write-session

 Cwrite-sessionwrite-sessionRecord the current file & window configuration.

The new write-session command writes a session file, detailing the
files you're currently editing, the window configuration, default
search strings, and so forth.  By default, Epsilon writes a session
file automatically whenever you exit, but you can use this command if
you prefer to save and restore sessions manually.

“write-session

2write-state

 Cwrite-statewrite-state–l rSave all commands and variables for later automatic loading.Ctrl-F3—

This command prompts for a file name.  It alters any extension to
".sta", and then loads the documentation file and records the
position of each of the definitions in it (to speed up the help
system).  Epsilon then writes all its commands, variables, and
bindings to the named file.  Restarting Epsilon with the command
"epsilon -sfilename", where "filename" denotes the name of the
state file, makes Epsilon use the commands in that file.  Epsilon
normally uses the state file "epsilon.sta".

“write-state

2yank

 Cyankyank–l rInsert the contents of a kill buffer.Ctrl-Y—

This command inserts the contents of the last kill buffer at point,
then positions point after the insertion, and the mark before it.  In
some modes this command then reindents the inserted text.  See the
¬reindent-after-yank≈reindent-after-yank variable.  If another
program has placed text on the Windows clipboard, this command will
use it instead of the kill buffer, except in keyboard macros.  See
the ¬clipboard-access≈clipboard-access variable for more
information.

If the kill buffer contains a rectangle, the command inserts it at
the current column, on the current and successive lines.  It shifts
existing text to the right, unless you've enabled overwrite mode, in
which case the block replaces any existing text in those columns.

“yank

2yank-pop

 Cyank-popyank-pop–l rCycle through previous kill buffers.Alt-Y—

This command replaces the just-yanked kill buffer with the contents
of the previous kill buffer.  It only works after a yank or
yank-pop command.

“yank-pop

2zoom-window

 Czoom-windowzoom-window–l rZoom in on the current window.Ctrl-X Z—

This command, like the one-window command, makes the current
window occupy the entire screen.  But it also saves away the old
window configuration.  Later, when you invoke zoom-window again,
it restores the old window configuration.

“zoom-window
1Variable Reference

”CvarsThis chapter lists all of Epsilon's variables in alphabetical order.

2abort-file-matching

 Vabort-file-matchingabort-file-matching‘abort-file-matching: variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon's file matching primitives respond to the abort key based on
the value of this variable.  If 0, they ignore the abort key.  If
1, they abort out of the calling function.  If 2, they return
an error code.  EEL functions that are prepared to handle aborting
should set this variable.

“abort-file-matching

2abort-key

 Vabort-keyabort-key‘abort-key: system variable
Default value: 7 (Ctrl-G)

Epsilon aborts the current command when you press the key whose value
is abort-key.  To disable the abort key, set abort-key to
-1.  By default, the abort-key variable is set to
Control-G.  For correct behavior, use the set-abort-key command
to set this variable.

“abort-key

2abort-searching

 Vabort-searchingabort-searching‘abort-searching: variable
Default value: -1

If the user presses the abort key during searching, Epsilon's
behavior depends upon the value of the abort-searching
variable.  If it's 0, the key is ignored and the search
continues.  If it's πMABORT_JUMP (-1, the default), Epsilon
aborts the search and jumps by calling the check_abort( )
primitive.  If it's πMABORT_ERROR (-2), Epsilon aborts the
search and returns the value πMABORT_ERROR.  The search(
), re_search( ), re_match( ), and
buffer_sort( ) primitives all use the abort-searching
variable to control aborting.

“abort-searching

2all-must-build-mode

 Vall-must-build-modeall-must-build-mode‘all-must-build-mode: variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon "precomputes" most of the text of each mode line, so it
doesn't have to figure out what to write each time it updates the
screen.  Setting the all-must-build-mode variable nonzero
warns Epsilon that all mode lines must be rebuilt.  Epsilon resets
the variable to zero after every screen update.

“all-must-build-mode

2already-made-backup

 Valready-made-backupalready-made-backup‘already-made-backup: system buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon sets this buffer-specific variable nonzero whenever it saves
a file and makes a backup.

“already-made-backup

2alt-invokes-menu

 Valt-invokes-menualt-invokes-menu‘alt-invokes-menu: preference variable
Default value: 0

In a typical Windows program, pressing and releasing the Alt key
without pressing any other key moves to the menu bar, highlighting
its first entry.  Set this variable to 1 if you want Epsilon to
do this.  The variable has no effect on what happens when you press
Alt and then press another key before releasing Alt: this will run
whatever command is bound to that key.  If you want Alt-E, for
example, to display the Edit menu, you can bind the command
invoke-windows-menu to it.

“alt-invokes-menu

2anon-ftp-password

 Vanon-ftp-passwordanon-ftp-password‘anon-ftp-password: preference variable
Default value: "-EpsilonUser@unknown.host"

When Epsilon uses FTP to read or write files to a computer on the
Internet, and logs in anonymously, it provides the contents of this
variable as a password.  (Anonymous FTP sites ask that you provide
your email address as a password when you log in anonymously.)  You
can set this to your email address.

“anon-ftp-password

2argc

 Vargcargc‘argc: system variable
Default value: varies

The argc≈argc variable contains the number of words on
Epsilon's command line, after Epsilon removes several flags it
processes internally.  The count includes the command name
"epsilon" at the start of the command line.

“argc

2auto-fill-indents

 Vauto-fill-indentsauto-fill-indents‘auto-fill-indents: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 1

When Epsilon automatically inserts new lines for you in auto fill
mode, it indents new lines (by calling the indenter function for the
current buffer) only if the buffer-specific variable
auto-fill-indents has a nonzero value.

“auto-fill-indents

2auto-indent

 Vauto-indentauto-indent‘auto-indent: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon can automatically indent for you when you press ⁄Enter€.
Setting the buffer-specific variable auto-indent nonzero makes
Epsilon do this.  The way Epsilon indents depends on the current
mode.  For example, C mode knows how to indent for C programs.  In
Epsilon's default mode, fundamental mode, Epsilon indents like
indent-previous if you set auto-indent nonzero.

“auto-indent

2auto-menu-bar

 Vauto-menu-barauto-menu-bar‘auto-menu-bar: preference variable
Default value: 1

If nonzero, moving the mouse past the top edge of the screen makes
Epsilon display the menu bar.  (DOS, OS/2 only)

“auto-menu-bar

2auto-read-changed-file

 Vauto-read-changed-fileauto-read-changed-file‘auto-read-changed-file: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, when Epsilon notices that a file on disk has a different
timestamp than the file in memory, it automatically reads the new
version of the file and displays a message to that effect.  Epsilon
won't do this if you've edited the copy of the file in memory, or if
the file's disk size is substantially smaller than it was.  In those
cases, Epsilon asks what to do.  Also see the variable want-warn.

“auto-read-changed-file

2auto-save-count

 Vauto-save-countauto-save-count‘auto-save-count: preference variable
Default value: 500

When want-auto-save is nonzero, Epsilon automatically saves a
copy of each unsaved file every auto-save-count keystrokes.

“auto-save-count

2auto-save-name

 Vauto-save-nameauto-save-name‘auto-save-name: preference variable
Default value: "%p%b.asv"

When want-auto-save is nonzero, Epsilon regularly saves a copy of
each unsaved file.  This variable contains a template which
determines how Epsilon chooses the file name for the autosaved file.
Epsilon substitutes pieces of the original file name for codes in the
template, as follows (examples are for the file c:¥dos¥read.me):
Œ%p The original file's path (c:¥dos¥).

Œ%b The base part of the original file name (read).

Œ%e The extension of the original file name (.me).

Œ%f The full name of the original file (c:¥dos¥read.me).

Œ%r The name of the file relative to the current directory.
(read.me if the current directory is c:¥dos, dos¥read.me if the
current directory is c:¥, otherwise c:¥dos¥read.me).

Œ%x The full pathname of the directory containing the Epsilon
executable.

Œ%X The full pathname of the directory containing the Epsilon
executable, after converting all Windows 95/98/NT long file names to
their equivalent short name aliases.



By default, Epsilon writes to a file with the same name and directory
but extension ".asv".

“auto-save-name

2auto-show-adjacent-delimiter

 Vauto-show-adjacent-delimiterauto-show-adjacent-delimiter‘auto-show-adjacent-delimiter: preference variable
Default value: 3

When the cursor is on a delimiter character in various language

Epsilon can subdivide the list of buffers displayed by the bufed
command, and sort each group separately.  This was Epsilon's behavior
prior to version 8.  First it listed buffers with associated files.
Then it listed buffers without files.  Finally (and only if you
invoked bufed with a numeric argument), Epsilon would list "system"

2build-first

 Vbuild-firstbuild-first‘build-first: window-specific variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon normally displays each window line by line, omitting lines
that have not changed.  When a command has moved point out of the
window, Epsilon must reposition the display point (the buffer
position at which to start displaying text) to return point to the
window.  However, Epsilon sometimes does not know that repositioning
is required until it has displayed the entire window.  When it
discovers that point is not in the window, Epsilon moves the display
point to a new position and immediately displays the window again.

2c-align-contin-lines

 Vc-align-contin-linesc-align-contin-lines‘c-align-contin-lines: preference variable
Default value: 48

By default, the C indenter tries to align continuation lines under
parentheses and other syntactic items on prior lines.  If Epsilon
can't find anything on prior lines to align with, or if aligning the
continuation line would make it start past column
c-align-contin-lines, Epsilon uses a fixed indentation: two
levels more than the original line, plus the value of the variable
c-contin-offset (normally zero).

Set this variable to zero if you don't want Epsilon to ever try to
align continuation lines under syntactic features in previous lines.
If zero, Epsilon indents continuation lines by one level (normally
one tab stop), plus the value of the variable c-contin-offset
(which may be negative).

2c-align-extra-space

 Eif, EEL keyword Vc-align-extra-spacec-align-extra-space‘c-align-extra-space: preference variable
Default value: 2

When C mode indents a continuation line, it tries to line up text
under previous syntactic constructs.  For instance, it may position
text just after a ( character on the previous line.  Sometimes
(commonly with continued if statements)
this causes the continuation line to be indented to the same column
as following lines.  If Epsilon thinks this will happen, it adds the
additional indentation specified by this variable to the continuation
line.

Epsilon can break long C/C++/Java/EEL comments as you type them,
using a variation of auto-fill mode.  Set this variable to 0 to
disable this feature.  Set it to 2 to let Epsilon break all comments.
The default value of 1 tells Epsilon not to break comments that
follow non-comment text on the same line, but permit Epsilon to break

“c-contin-offset

2c-extra-keywords

 Vc-extra-keywordsc-extra-keywords‘c-extra-keywords: system buffer-specific variable
Default value: 3

C mode automatically sets the buffer-specific
c-extra-keywords≈c-extra-keywords variable based on file name
extensions, to indicate which identifiers are considered keywords in
the current buffer.  The value 1 tells Epsilon to recognize C++
keywords when code coloring.  The value 2 tells Epsilon to recognize
EEL keywords.  The values 4 and 8 indicate Java and IDL keywords,
respectively.  Epsilon always recognizes those keywords common to C,
C++, Java, and EEL.

“c-extra-keywords

2c-fill-column

 Vc-fill-columnc-fill-column‘c-fill-column: preference variable
Default value: 72

This variable sets the default fill column for filling comments in
C/C++/Java buffers.  If positive, Epsilon uses it to initialize the
fill column whenever a buffer enters C mode.  (Otherwise Epsilon uses
the default value of the margin-right variable.)

“c-fill-column

2c-indent

 Vc-indentc-indent‘c-indent: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

C mode indents each additional level of nesting by this many columns.
If the variable is less than or equal to zero, Epsilon uses the value
of tab-size instead.  Set this variable if you want Epsilon to
use one number for displaying tab characters, and a different number
for indenting C code.  (Epsilon will indent using a combination of
spaces and tabs, as necessary.)

 Vc-look-backc-look-back‘c-look-back: preference variable
Default value: 40000

When C mode tries to determine the correct indentation of a line, it
looks back in the buffer at previous lines.  To prevent long delays,
Epsilon gives up if it finds itself looking back more than this many
characters, and uses its best indentation guess so far.

If this variable is nonzero, double-clicking the right mouse button
on a function or variable name in a C mode buffer makes Epsilon for
DOS or Epsilon for OS/2 jump to that item's definition.  Epsilon uses
the pluck-tag command to do this.  (In Epsilon for Windows, use

By default, if you press ⁄Tab€ when point is not in the current
line's indentation, C mode inserts a tab character instead of
recomputing the current line's indentation.  If this variable is
nonzero, the ⁄Tab€ key will reindent the current line, regardless of

the transcript in a buffer named "process".

“capture-output

2case-fold

 Vcase-foldcase-fold‘case-fold: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 1

If nonzero, Epsilon considers upper case and lower case the same when
searching, so a search string of "Word" would match "word" and
"WORD" as well.  This variable sets the default for a search in
each buffer, but when searching you can change case-folding status
for that particular search by pressing Ctrl-C.

“case-fold

2catch-mouse

 Vcatch-mousecatch-mouse‘catch-mouse: preference variable
Default value: varies

If nonzero, Epsilon queues up mouse events.  If zero, Epsilon ignores
the mouse.

Under DOS, various values of catch_mouse correspond to
settings of the -km, -kc and -kw switches.  A setting of 1 gives
default mouse behavior.  A setting of 2 makes the mouse cursor
invisible, like -kc0.  A setting of 3 makes Epsilon uses absolute
positioning, like -km1.  A setting of 4 makes Epsilon use
absolute positioning with an invisible mouse cursor, like -kw, the
correct setting for windowed environments.

If you run Epsilon for DOS under Microsoft Windows full-screen, be
sure to set catch-mouse to 4 before you press Alt-Enter to switch
to a window.  You can set catch-mouse back to 1 when you return
Epsilon to full-screen.  The same comments apply when running the DOS
version under OS/2 PM.

If this variable is non-zero, all commands that put text on the kill
ring will also try to copy the text to the MS-Windows or X clipboard.
Similarly, the yank command will retrieve any new text from the
clipboard before retrieving text from Epsilon's kill ring if this
variable is nonzero.

If you're not running the Windows, Unix or DOS versions of Epsilon,
not running under MS-Windows in enhanced mode or under the X window
system, or (for the DOS version) the text has more than 65,500
characters, Epsilon ignores the clipboard, just as if this variable
were zero.  During a keyboard macro Epsilon also ignores the
clipboard contents.  Use the insert-clipboard or

from OEM ANSI to Windows ANSI.  Epsilon needs to do this so that
international characters display correctly.  When Epsilon retrieves
characters from the clipboard, it has Windows perform the reverse
translation.

But each character set contains some characters that the other does
not, so that copying characters in one direction and then back can
change the characters.  Instead, you can tell Epsilon to copy
characters without translating them.  Then copying back and forth
will never change the characters, but Epsilon for DOS and Windows
won't display the same symbols for any character except the original
ASCII printable characters (32 to 127).

Setting this variable to 7 makes Epsilon tell Windows that all text
in Epsilon is in the OEM character set, and Windows must translate
between OEM ANSI and Windows ANSI.  Setting the variable to 1 makes
Epsilon tell Windows that all text in Epsilon uses the Windows ANSI
character set, so no translating is necessary.  The default value of
zero makes Epsilon for DOS always translate, and makes Epsilon for
Windows translate only when you've selected an OEM font.  (Epsilon
uses the value of this variable as the "clipboard format" to ask
Windows for; you can see the raw clipboard data Windows uses by
setting the variable to other values, if you like.  Epsilon for Unix
ignores this variable.)

“clipboard-format

2closeback

 Vclosebackcloseback‘closeback: preference variable
Default value: 1

If nonzero, C mode aligns a right brace character that ends a block
with the line containing the matching left brace character.  If zero,
C mode aligns the right brace character with the first statement
inside the block.

2color-html-look-back

 Vcolor-html-look-backcolor-html-look-back‘color-html-look-back: preference variable
Default value: 50000

When Epsilon begins coloring HTML in the middle of a buffer, it has
to determine whether it's inside a script by searching back.  This
can be slow in very large HTML files, so Epsilon limits its search by
assuming that a script can be no longer than this many characters.

“color-html-look-back

2color-look-back

 Vcolor-look-backcolor-look-back‘color-look-back: preference variable
Default value: 0

When Epsilon begins coloring in the middle of a buffer, it has to
determine whether it's inside a comment by searching back for comment
characters.  If color-look-back is greater than zero, Epsilon
only looks back over that many characters for a block comment
delimiter like /* or */ before giving up and concluding that
the original text is not inside a comment.  If you edit extremely
large C files with few block comments, you can speed up Epsilon by
setting this variable.  Any block comments larger than this value may
not be colored correctly.  A value of zero (the default) lets Epsilon
search as far as it needs to, and correctly colors comments of any
size.

“color-look-back

2color-names

Default value: 0

Epsilon's syntax highlighting functions use this variable to record
various types of status.  Bits in the variable are specified by
macros in colcode.h.

Epsilon uses some bits independently of any particular language mode.
COLOR_DO_COLORING indicates that Epsilon should perform coloring.
COLOR_IN_PROGRESS means Epsilon is in the middle of coloring; Epsilon
uses this bit to detect when a coloring function has aborted due to a
programming error; it then disables coloring for that buffer.
COLOR_MINIMAL
records whether minimal coloring (an option in C/C++/Java mode) is in
use for that buffer; Epsilon uses it to notice when this setting has
changed.

COLOR_INVALIDATE_FORWARD indicates that after the user modifies a buffer, any
syntax highlighting information after the modified region should be
discarded.
COLOR_INVALIDATE_BACKWARD indicates that syntax highlighting information before
the modified region should be discarded.  (Without these bits,
Epsilon only discards syntax highlighting information that's very
close to the modified part of the buffer.)
COLOR_INVALIDATE_RESETS tells Epsilon that whenever it invalidates syntax
highlighting in a region, it should also set the color of all text in
that region to the default of -1.

2comment-pattern

 Vcomment-patterncomment-pattern‘comment-pattern: buffer-specific variable
Default value: ";.*$"

The comment commands look for comments using regular expression
patterns contained in the buffer-specific variables
comment-pattern≈comment-pattern (which should match the whole
comment) and ¬comment-start≈comment-start (which should match the
sequence that begins a comment, like "/*").

“comment-pattern

2comment-repeat-indentation-lines

 Vcomment-repeat-indentation-linescomment-repeat-indentation-lines‘comment-repeat-indentation-lines: preference variable
Default value: 2

Modes that provide language-sensitive indenting, such as C mode (for
C, C++, Java, and EEL) and Perl mode, typically indent single-line
comments (such as C++'s // comments) to the same indentation level as
code.  Sometimes in the midst of a block of indented code, you may
wish to write a series of comment lines with some different
indentation.

When Epsilon notices that the 2 previous lines are comment lines, its
auto-indenter decides that a blank line that follows should be
indented like them, and not as if the line will contain code.  Set
this variable to change the number of comment lines Epsilon checks
for.  Set it to zero to make Epsilon always indent blank lines based
on language syntax rules.

“comment-repeat-indentation-lines

2comment-start

This variable says whether the compare-windows command should
consider any run of one or more whitespace characters in one buffer
to match a run of one or more whitespace characters in the other.  If
0, it doesn't, and requires all characters to match.  If 1,
it merges runs of spaces, tabs and newlines.  If 2, it merges

The compile-buffer command retrieves the command to compile the
current buffer from this buffer-specific variable.  For C, C++, and
EEL files this variable normally just points to the
compile-c-cmd, compile-cpp-cmd, or compile-eel-cmd

Epsilon uses the command line contained in the
compile-c-cmd≈compile-c-cmd variable to compile C files; those
files ending with a .c extension.  (Epsilon for Unix uses the
compile-c-cmd-unix variable instead.)

The command line works as a file name template, so you can substitute
parts of the file name into the command line.  The sequence %p
substitutes the path part of the file name, the sequence %b
substitutes the base name (without path or extension), the sequence
%e substitutes the extension (including the "."), the sequence
%f substitutes the full name as an absolute pathname, and the
sequence %r substitutes a pathname relative to the current
directory.  The sequence %x substitutes the full pathname of the
directory containing the Epsilon executable.  The sequence %X
substitutes the same pathname to the Epsilon executable, but converts
all Windows 95/98/NT long file names to their equivalent short name

The window-specific cursor-to-column variable lets you
position the cursor in a part of a window where there are no
characters.  It's normally -1, and the cursor stays on the

When you read an existing file, Epsilon consults this variable to
determine what kind of line translation to perform.  If 5
(πMFILETYPE_AUTO), Epsilon examines the file's contents and
selects one of the following translations, setting the buffer's
translation-type variable to the selected translation.  If this
variable is set to any other value, Epsilon uses the specified
translation without examining the contents of the file.

A value of 0 (πMFILETYPE_BINARY) makes Epsilon do no line
translation, 1 (πMFILETYPE_MSDOS) makes Epsilon strip
⁄Return€ characters when reading and insert them when writing, 2
(πMFILETYPE_UNIX) makes Epsilon do no line translation, but
indicates that the file contains text, 3 (πMFILETYPE_MAC)

indicate that the current buffer doesn't require any such warning.

“discardable-buffer

2display-column

 Vdisplay-columndisplay-column‘display-column: preference window-specific variable
Default value: 0

This variable determines how Epsilon displays long lines.  If
negative, Epsilon displays buffer lines too big to fit on one screen
line on multiple screen lines, with a special character to indicate
that the line has been wrapped.  If display-column is 0 or
positive, Epsilon only displays the part of a line that fits on the
screen.  Epsilon also skips over the initial display-column
columns of each line when displayed.  Horizontal scrolling works by
adjusting the display column.

“display-column

2display-definition

function name, displaying Vdisplay-definitiondisplay-definition‘display-definition: preference variable
Default value: 1

In C/C++/Java/Perl buffers, Epsilon can
display the name of the current function, subroutine, class, or
structure on a buffer's mode line, or in the title bar of Epsilon's
window.  Set this variable to 2 if you want Epsilon to use the
title bar if possible.  Epsilon for DOS, and other versions that
can't set the title bar, will instead use the mode line.  Set this
variable to 1 if you want to use the mode line regardless.  Or
set this variable to 0 to disable this feature.  You can modify
the mode-end variable to position the name within the mode line.

“display-definition

2display-func-name

 Vdisplay-func-namedisplay-func-name‘display-func-name: system variable
Default value: none

Epsilon uses this variable to help display the name of the current
function on the mode line or window title bar.  It contains the most
recent function name Epsilon found.

“display-func-name

2display-func-name-buf

 Vdisplay-func-name-bufdisplay-func-name-buf‘display-func-name-buf: system variable
Default value: none

Epsilon uses this variable to help display the name of the current
function on the mode line or window title bar.  It contains the
buffer number of the buffer where display-func-name is valid.

“display-func-name-buf

2display-func-name-win

 Vdisplay-func-name-windisplay-func-name-win‘display-func-name-win: system variable
Default value: none

Epsilon uses this variable to help display the name of the current
function on the mode line or window title bar.  It contains the
window number of the window where display-func-name is valid.

“display-func-name-win

2display-scroll-bar

 Vdisplay-scroll-bardisplay-scroll-bar‘display-scroll-bar: system window-specific variable
Default value: 0

This variable controls whether the current window's right border
contains a scroll bar.  Set it to zero to turn off the scroll bar, or
to any positive number to display the bar.  If a window has no right
border, or has room for fewer than two lines of text, Epsilon won't
display a scroll bar.  Although the EEL functions that come with
Epsilon don't support clicking on a scroll bar on the left border of
a window, Epsilon will display one if the variable is negative.  Any
positive value produces the usual right-border scroll bar.  Run the
toggle-scroll-bar command instead of setting this internal
variable directly.

“display-scroll-bar

2double-click-time

 Vdouble-click-timedouble-click-time‘double-click-time: preference variable
Default value: 40

This variable specifies how long a delay to allow for mouse
double-clicks, in hundredths of a second.  If two consecutive mouse
clicks occur within the allotted time, Epsilon considers the second a
double-click.  Epsilon for Windows ignores this variable and uses
standard Windows settings to determine double-clicks.

“double-click-time

2draw-column-marker

 Vdraw-column-markerdraw-column-marker‘draw-column-marker: preference variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, Epsilon for Windows draws a vertical line in the current
window, at the column number specified by this variable.  This can be
helpful when editing fixed-width files.

“draw-column-marker

2draw-focus-rectangle

 Vdraw-focus-rectangledraw-focus-rectangle‘draw-focus-rectangle: preference variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, Epsilon for Windows draws a focus box around the current
line, to make it easier for a user to locate the caret.  A value of 1
produces a normal-sized focus rectangle.  You can customize its shape
by setting this variable to a four-digit number.  The four digits
represent the left, right, top and bottom sides of rectangle.  The
digit 5 represents the normal position of that side; lower values
constrict the box and higher values expand it.  For instance, 5555
represents the usual box size, while 1199 represents a box that's
extra narrow at its sides but extra tall.

“draw-focus-rectangle

2echo-line

 Vecho-lineecho-line‘echo-line: preference variable
Default value: 24 on a 25-line screen

This variable contains the number of the screen line on which to
display the echo area, counting from zero at the top.  When the
screen size changes, Epsilon automatically adjusts this variable if
necessary.

“echo-line

2eel-version

 Veel-versioneel-version‘eel-version: variable
Default value: varies

This variable records the version number of the commands contained in
the state file.  Epsilon's -quickup flag sets this number.  Epsilon
compares this number to the version number stored in its executable
and warns of mismatches (indicating that the state file must be
updated by running -quickup).

“eel-version

2epsilon-manual-port

 Vepsilon-manual-portepsilon-manual-port‘epsilon-manual-port: preference variable
Default value: 8888

When Epsilon displays its online manual in HTML format, it runs a
documentation server program, and constructs a URL that tells the web
browser how to talk to the documentation server.  The URL includes a
port number, specified by this variable.  Set the variable to 0 and
Epsilon won't run a local documentation server, but will instead
connect to Lugaru's web site.  Note that the manual pages on Lugaru's
web site may be for a later version of Epsilon than local pages.

“epsilon-manual-port

2errno

 Verrnoerrno‘errno: variable
Default value: 0

Many Epsilon primitive functions that access operating system
features set this variable to the operating system's error code if an
error occurs.

“errno

2expand-wildcards

 Vexpand-wildcardsexpand-wildcards‘expand-wildcards: preference variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, when you specify a file name with wild cards on Epsilon's
command line, Epsilon reads each individual file that matches the
pattern, as if you had listed them explicitly.  If zero, Epsilon
displays a list of the files that matched the pattern, in a ¬dired
buffer.

“expand-wildcards

2expire-message

 Vexpire-messageexpire-message‘expire-message: system variable
Default value: -1

An EEL function sometimes needs to display some text in the echo area
that is only valid until the user performs some action.  For
instance, a command that displays the number of characters in the
buffer might wish to clear that count if the user inserts or deletes
some characters.  After displaying text with primitives like say(
), note( ), or error( ), an EEL function may set
this variable 1 to tell Epsilon to clear that text on the next user
key.

“expire-message

2explicit-session-file

 Vexplicit-session-fileexplicit-session-file‘explicit-session-file: system variable
Default value: none

If you use the read-session or write-session commands to use
a particular session file, Epsilon stores its name in this variable.

“explicit-session-file

2extra-video-modes

 Vextra-video-modesRextra-video-modesextra-video-modes‘extra-video-modes: preference variable
Default value: 0

Set the
extra-video-modes≈extra-video-modes variable to enable the
additional video modes Epsilon automatically provides under DOS.
Besides Epsilon's built-in video modes, Epsilon can look for a VESA
TSR or an Ultravision TSR, and retrieve a list of additional video
modes from them.

Set this variable to 1 to disable Ultravision modes but look for
VESA modes.  Set it to 2 to disable VESA modes but look for
Ultravision modes.  Set it to 3 to look for both types of TSR's.
The default value of 0 disables both types of add-on modes.

If both Ultravision and VESA TSR's are installed, the Ultravision TSR
takes precedence.  Epsilon only examines the value of this variable
when it starts up, so you must set it, use the write-state
command, and restart Epsilon for a new setting to take effect.

“extra-video-modes

2far-pause

 Vfar-pausefar-pause‘far-pause: preference variable
Default value: 100

The find-delimiter and show-matching-delimiter commands pause
this many hundredths of a second, when they must reposition the
screen to a different part of the buffer to show the matching
delimiter.

“far-pause

2file-date-tolerance

 Vfile-date-tolerancefile-date-tolerance‘file-date-tolerance: preference variable
Default value: 2

Epsilon warns when a file has changed on disk.  Sometimes files on a
network will change their recorded times shortly after Epsilon writes
to them.  So Epsilon ignores very small changes in a file's time.
Set this variable to change the time difference in seconds that
Epsilon will ignore.

“file-date-tolerance

2filename

 Vfilenamefilename‘filename: buffer-specific variable
Default value: none

This variable holds the file name associated with the current buffer.

“filename

2fill-mode

 Vfill-modefill-mode‘fill-mode: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

This variable controls auto filling.  If nonzero, Epsilon breaks text
into lines as you type it, by changing spaces into newline
characters.  See the variable c-auto-fill-mode for the equivalent
variable used in C mode buffers.

“fill-mode

2final-macro-pause

 Vfinal-macro-pausefinal-macro-pause‘final-macro-pause: system variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon sets this variable to 1 when a keyboard macro ends with a
pause-macro command, to help it execute the macro correctly.

“final-macro-pause

2find-lines-visible

 Vfind-lines-visiblefind-lines-visible‘find-lines-visible: preference variable
Default value: 8

Epsilon uses the find-lines-visible variable to help determine
where to position the find/replace dialog box.  It considers a
possible location acceptable if the top find-lines-visible lines
of the current window can be seen behind the dialog.  If fewer lines
are visible, Epsilon will move the dialog to another part of the
screen.

If you don't want Epsilon to ever reposition its find/replace dialog,
set this variable to zero.

“find-lines-visible

2find-linked-file-ignores-angles

 Vfind-linked-file-ignores-anglesfind-linked-file-ignores-angles‘find-linked-file-ignores-angles: preference variable
Default value: 0

If this variable is nonzero, the find-linked-file command treats
the <> notation in a #include directive found in a C/C++/Java
buffer the same as the "" notation.  That is, Epsilon searches in
the original file's directory for the included file, before looking
in other directories. If this variable is zero, then only
#include directives that use the "" notation will cause
Epsilon to search locally.

“find-linked-file-ignores-angles

2first-window-refresh

 Vfirst-window-refreshfirst-window-refresh‘first-window-refresh: variable
Default value: 1

Epsilon sets this variable prior to calling a when_displaying
function to indicate if this is the first window the current buffer
is displayed in.  If 0, Epsilon has already called the
when_displaying function for this buffer during the current
screen update.  Otherwise, this is the first window displaying this
buffer.

“first-window-refresh

2font-dialog

 Vfont-dialogfont-dialog‘font-dialog: preference variable
Default value: "Courier New,8,0,400,0,1"

This variable controls what font Epsilon for Windows uses for its
dialog windows.  See font-fixed for details on its format.  Use
the set-dialog-font command to set it.

“font-dialog

2font-fixed

 Vfont-fixedfont-fixed‘font-fixed: preference variable
Default value: "Courier New,10,0,400,0,1"

This variable controls what font Epsilon for Windows uses.  It
contains the name of the font, followed by several numbers separated
by commas.  The first number specifies a point size.  The second
specifies the width of the font in pixels, or 0 if any width is
acceptable.  A small number of fonts, such as Terminal, have multiple
widths for each height.  The third number specifies how bold the font
is.  A typical font uses a value of 400, while a bold font is usually
700.  The fourth number is nonzero to indicate an italic font.  The
fifth number indicates a character set; 1 means use the default
character set for the font, 0 means use ANSI, 255 means use OEM.

“font-fixed

2font-printer

 Vfont-printerfont-printer‘font-printer: preference variable
Default value: "Courier New,10,0,400,0,1"

This variable controls what font Epsilon for Windows uses when
printing.  See font-fixed for details on its format.  Use the
set-printer-font command to set it.

“font-printer

2force-save-as

 PFSA_READONLY, textual macro PFSA_NEWFILE, textual macro Vforce-save-asMFSA_READONLYMFSA_NEWFILEforce-save-as‘force-save-as: system buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

Setting this variable nonzero instructs the save-file command to
ask for a file name before writing the file.  A setting of 1
(FSA_NEWFILE in EEL
functions) indicates the buffer was created by the new-file
command.  A setting of 2
(FSA_READONLY)
indicates the file was marked read-only on disk, or the user checked
the "Open as read-only" box in the Open File dialog.

“force-save-as

2ftp-ascii-transfers

VMS Vftp-ascii-transfersRftp-ascii-transfersftp-ascii-transfers‘ftp-ascii-transfers: preference variable
Default value: 0

When Epsilon uses FTP to read a file on a
host computer, it normally uses FTP's binary transfer mode, and
examines the contents of the file to determine the appropriate line
translation.  On some kinds of host computers (VMS systems,
for example) this doesn't work.  If you use such systems, set this
variable nonzero.  In that case, you'll need to tell Epsilon whenever
you transfer a binary file.  Epsilon will use FTP's ASCII transfer
mode for all files except those where you explicitly set the line
transfer mode to binary (for example, by typing Ctrl-U Ctrl-X Ctrl-F,
and then pressing B at the line translation prompt).

“ftp-ascii-transfers

2ftp-compatible-dirs

 Vftp-compatible-dirsftp-compatible-dirs‘ftp-compatible-dirs: preference variable
Default value: 0

When Epsilon uses FTP to access files on a host computer, it normally
assumes that the directory conventions of the host computer are
similar to those for Unix, Windows, DOS, and OS/2.  Some computers
(notably some VMS systems) use different rules for directories.
Setting this variable nonzero makes Epsilon access remote directories
in a way that's slower, but works on more systems.

“ftp-compatible-dirs

2ftp-passive-transfers

 Vftp-passive-transfersftp-passive-transfers‘ftp-passive-transfers: preference variable
Default value: 1

This variable controls how Epsilon's FTP client transfers files.
Epsilon knows two methods, called "passive" and "active", and
normally tries them in that order.  Firewalls or broken FTP server
software can cause one or the other method to fail.  Set this
variable to zero to disable passive transfers.  Set it to two to make
Epsilon try active transfers first, then passive.  The default of one
makes Epsilon try passive, then active.

“ftp-passive-transfers

2full-redraw

 Vfull-redrawfull-redraw‘full-redraw: variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, Epsilon rebuilds all mode lines, as well as any
precomputed information Epsilon may have on window borders, screen
colors, and so forth, on the next redisplay.  Epsilon then resets the
variable to zero.

“full-redraw

2fwd-search-key

 Vfwd-search-keyfwd-search-key‘fwd-search-key: preference variable
Default value: -1

Inside a search command, Epsilon recognizes a key with this key code
as a synonym for Ctrl-S, for pulling in a default search string or
changing the search direction.

“fwd-search-key

2gams-auto-show-delim-chars

 Vgams-auto-show-delim-charsgams-auto-show-delim-chars‘gams-auto-show-delim-chars: variable
Default value: "[()]"

This variable holds the set of delimiter characters that should
trigger Epsilon's auto-show-delimiters feature in GAMS mode.  Epsilon
will search for and highlight the match to this delimiter.

“gams-auto-show-delim-chars

2gams-files

 Vgams-filesgams-files‘gams-files: preference variable
Default value: 0

The file extensions .inc, .map, and .dat are used in the GAMS
language for mathematical programming.  But they're also commonly
used to represent other things.  By default Epsilon assumes such
files are not GAMS files; set this variable nonzero if you want
Epsilon to assume they are GAMS files.

“gams-files

2goal-column

 Vgoal-columngoal-column‘goal-column: buffer-specific variable
Default value: -1

If the goal-column variable is non-negative, the up-line and
down-line commands always move to the goal column.  If
goal-column is negative, the commands try to remain in the same
column.

“goal-column

2got-bad-number

 Vgot-bad-numbergot-bad-number‘got-bad-number: system variable
Default value: 0

Several EEL functions that convert a character string into a number
set this variable to indicate whether the string held a valid number.

“got-bad-number

2grep-empties-buffer

 Vgrep-empties-buffergrep-empties-buffer‘grep-empties-buffer: preference variable
Default value: 0

By default, each invocation of grep appends its results to the
grep buffer.  If you set the variable grep-empties-buffer to a
nonzero value, grep will clear the grep buffer at the start of
each invocation.

“grep-empties-buffer

2grep-ignore-file-extensions

 Vgrep-ignore-file-extensionsgrep-ignore-file-extensions‘grep-ignore-file-extensions: preference variable
Default value: "|.obj|.exe|.o|.b|.dll|.lib|"

This variable contains a list of file name extensions for Epsilon to
skip over during a grep or file-query-replace command.  Each
extension must appear surrounded by "|" characters.

“grep-ignore-file-extensions

2grep-keeps-files

 Vgrep-keeps-filesgrep-keeps-files‘grep-keeps-files: preference variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, the grep command reads each file matching the
supplied pattern using the find-file command.  If zero, Epsilon
reads each file into a temporary buffer and discards the buffer after
it finishes listing the matches.

“grep-keeps-files

2grep-prompt-with-buffer-directory

 Vgrep-prompt-with-buffer-directorygrep-prompt-with-buffer-directory‘grep-prompt-with-buffer-directory: preference variable
Default value: 1

The grep-prompt-with-buffer-directory variable controls how the
grep and file-query-replace commands use the current
directory at file prompts.  It recognizes the same values as for
prompt-with-buffer-directory.

“grep-prompt-with-buffer-directory

2gui-cursor-shape

 Vgui-cursor-shapegui-cursor-shape‘gui-cursor-shape: system variable
Default value: 100002

This variable holds the current cursor shape code under Windows and
Unix's X windowing system.  Epsilon copies values from
overwrite-gui-cursor, normal-gui-cursor, or one of the other
cursor variables, as appropriate, into this variable whenever you
switch windows or buffers.  Set those variables instead of this one.
Epsilon only uses this variable under Windows and X.  See
cursor-shape for the non-graphical equivalent.

trigger Epsilon's auto-show-delimiters feature in HTML mode.  Epsilon
will search for and highlight the match to this delimiter.

“html-auto-show-delim-chars

2html-javascript-coloring

 Vhtml-javascript-coloringhtml-javascript-coloring‘html-javascript-coloring: variable
Default value: 1

Epsilon will syntax highlight Java scripts embedded in HTML documents
if this variable is nonzero.  Set this variable to zero if you want
Epsilon to use a single color for scripts embedded in HTML documents.

“html-javascript-coloring

2idle-coloring-delay

 Vidle-coloring-delayidle-coloring-delay‘idle-coloring-delay: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 100

When Epsilon isn't busy acting on your keystrokes, it looks through
the current buffer and assigns colors to the individual regions of
text, so that Epsilon responds faster as you scroll through the
buffer.  For smoother performance, Epsilon doesn't begin to do this
until it's been idle for a certain period of time, specified by this
variable.  Set it to the number of hundredths of a second to wait
before computing more coloring information.  With its default value
of 100, Epsilon waits one second.  Set it to -1 to disable
background code coloring.

“idle-coloring-delay

2idle-coloring-size

 Vidle-coloring-sizeidle-coloring-size‘idle-coloring-size: system buffer-specific variable
Default value: 1000

While waiting for the next keystroke, Epsilon syntax-highlights the
rest of the current buffer to improve performance.  It highlights in
small sections.  This variable determines the size of each section.
Some language modes highlight faster when they can work with larger
sections.

“idle-coloring-size

2ignore-error

2initial-tag-file

 Vinitial-tag-fileinitial-tag-file‘initial-tag-file: preference variable
Default value: "default.tag"

This variable holds the name of the tag file Epsilon will search for.
If it holds a relative pathname, Epsilon will search for the file in
the current directory tree.  If initial-tag-file holds an
absolute pathname, Epsilon will always use that tag file.

“initial-tag-file

2insert-default-response

 Vinsert-default-responseinsert-default-response‘insert-default-response: preference variable
Default value: 1

If this variable is 1, at many prompts Epsilon will insert a
default response before you start typing.  The default response will
be highlighted, so typing any text will remove it.  If you turn off
typing-deletes-highlight, you may wish to set this variable to
0.

While prompting for text, Epsilon can temporarily set this variable
to other values.  A value of 2 makes Epsilon insert its default
text without highlighting it.  This means the text won't
automatically be deleted when you begin typing.  A value of 3
inserts the default text, doesn't highlight it, and prepares to
modify your file name response as you type it.  See the description
of prompt-with-buffer-directory.

“insert-default-response

2invisible-window

 Vinvisible-windowinvisible-window‘invisible-window: system window-specific variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, Epsilon won't display the text of the window (although it

modify the part of the screen that would ordinarily display the
window's text.

“invisible-window

2is-current-window

 Vis-current-windowis-current-window‘is-current-window: system variable

current window, not in other windows that display the same buffer.

“is-current-window

2is-gui

 Vis-guiis-gui‘is-gui: variable
Default value: varies

The is-gui variable indicates whether a graphical version of
Epsilon is running.  In pure-text versions of Epsilon, this variable
is zero.  When the 32-bit Windows version of Epsilon runs under
Windows NT, it sets this variable to 2.  Under Windows 95/98, it
sets this variable to 3.  The variable is 1 when the 32-bit
version runs under Windows 3.1 using the Win32S package (though this
is not supported).  The 16-bit version of Epsilon for Windows 3.1
always sets this variable to 4.

“is-gui

This variable is nonzero if a version of Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT
is running, either the GUI version or the Win32 console version.  The
constant πMIS_WIN32_GUI
represents the former.  The constant
πMIS_WIN32_CONSOLE
represents the latter.

Epsilon indicates that a command has received a numeric argument by
setting the has-arg variable nonzero, and setting iter to the
value of the numeric argument.

“iter

2kbd-extended

 Vkbd-extendedkbd-extended‘kbd-extended: variable
Default value: varies

This variable tells whether the -ke flag was used to make the numeric
pad and cursor pad keys distinct.  Normally, both are treated the
same, and this variable is zero.  If you give the -ke flag, Epsilon
treats these as separate sets of keys, and makes the variable nonzero.

“kbd-extended

2key

 Vkeykey‘key: variable
Default value: none

This holds the value of the last key pressed, or a special code
indicating a mouse event.

“key

2key-code

 Vkey-codekey-code‘key-code: variable
Default value: none

This variable contains the sixteen-bit BIOS encoding for the last key
that Epsilon received from the operating system.  Its ASCII code is
in the low eight bits and its scan code is in the high eight bits.
This variable is always 0 under Windows or Unix, when the key
comes from a macro, or (under DOS) when Epsilon translates a key
without using the BIOS.

“key-code

2key-from-macro

 Vkey-from-macrokey-from-macro‘key-from-macro: variable
Default value: varies

This variable is nonzero whenever the most recent key (or mouse
event) came from a keyboard macro, not an actual keypress.

“key-from-macro

2key-is-button

 Vkey-is-buttonkey-is-button‘key-is-button: system variable
Default value: varies

When you click on a button in a dialog, Epsilon returns a particular
fixed keystroke: Ctrl-M, the abort key specified by the abort-key
variable, or the help key specified by the πMHELPKEY macro.
To distinguish actual keys from these buttons, Epsilon sets the
key_is_button≈key_is_button variable to zero when returning
normal keys, and to 1 when returning one of these button keys.

“key-is-button

2key-repeat-rate

 Vkey-repeat-ratekey-repeat-rate‘key-repeat-rate: preference variable
Default value: 40

Under DOS and Windows, this variable controls the rate at which keys
repeat in Epsilon, in repeats per second.  Setting this variable to 0
lets the keyboard determine the repeat rate, as it does outside of
Epsilon.  Setting this variable to -1 makes keys repeat as fast as
possible.  Epsilon never lets repeated keys pile up; it automatically
ignores repeated keys when necessary.

“key-repeat-rate

2key-type

 Vkey-typekey-type‘key-type: variable
Default value: none

This variable has a special code that identifies the type of key
pressed.  Epsilon uses the key type to implement its auto-quoting
facility.

“key-type

2kill-buffers

 Vkill-bufferskill-buffers‘kill-buffers: preference variable
Default value: 10

This variable holds the maximum number of kill buffers, for holding
killed text.  Setting this variable to a new value makes Epsilon
throw away the contents of all the kill buffers the next time you
execute a command that uses kill buffers.

“kill-buffers

2last-index

 Vlast-indexlast-index‘last-index: variable
Default value: none

The do_command( ) primitive copies the name table index it
receives as a parameter into this variable, just before it executes
the indicated command, so the help system can find the name of the
current command (among other uses).

“last-index

2last-show-spaces

 Vlast-show-spaceslast-show-spaces‘last-show-spaces: system buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon records the previous value of the show-spaces variable
here, to detect changes to it.

“last-show-spaces

2last-window-color-scheme

 Vlast-window-color-schemelast-window-color-scheme‘last-window-color-scheme: system variable
Default value: 0

When Epsilon has been set to display its tiled windows without
borders (via the toggle-borders command), it uses this variable
to help assign separate color schemes to the individual windows.

“last-window-color-scheme

2latex-2e-or-3

 Vlatex-2e-or-3latex-2e-or-3‘latex-2e-or-3: preference variable
Default value: 1

Set this variable to 0 if you want LaTeX mode commands like
tex-italic on Alt-i to insert a LaTeX 2.09 command, instead of a
LaTeX 2e/3 command.  (For example, tex-italic inserts ¥textit in
LaTeX 2e/3 mode, and ¥it otherwise.)

“latex-2e-or-3

2leave-blank

 Vleave-blankleave-blank‘leave-blank: variable
Default value: 0

When Epsilon is about to exit, it normally redisplays each mode line
one last time just before exiting, but only if this variable is zero.

“leave-blank

2line-in-window

 Vline-in-windowline-in-window‘line-in-window: variable
Default value: none

On each screen refresh, Epsilon sets this variable to the line of
point within the current window, counting from zero.  If you switch
windows or move point, Epsilon will not update this variable until
the next refresh.

“line-in-window

2load-fail-ok

 Vload-fail-okload-fail-ok‘load-fail-ok: system variable
Default value: 0

If Epsilon cannot autoload a called EEL function, it will report an
error.  An EEL subroutine may set this variable nonzero to make
Epsilon silently ignore such a function call.

“load-fail-ok

2load-from-state

 Vload-from-stateload-from-state‘load-from-state: variable
Default value: varies

Epsilon sets this variable to 1 if it loaded its functions from a
state file at startup, or 0 if it loaded only from bytecode files.

“load-from-state

2locate-path-unix

 Vlocate-path-unixlocate-path-unix‘locate-path-unix: preference variable
Default value: "/µ*bin*,etc,home*,lib,opt,root,usr*,var*∂/**/"

Under Unix, the locate-file command uses this variable to decide
where to look for a file.  It contains part of an extended file
pattern that should match those directories where Epsilon should
look.  The specified file name will be appended to this value.  It's
a good idea to make sure special file systems like /proc are not
matched by the pattern.

“locate-path-unix

2macro-runs-immediately

 Vmacro-runs-immediatelymacro-runs-immediately‘macro-runs-immediately: variable
Default value: 1

When an EEL function says to run a keyboard macro, Epsilon can do it
two ways.  Normally Epsilon enters a recursive edit loop, and
executes keys from the macro.  When the macro ends, Epsilon exits the
recursive edit loop, and returns to the EEL function that said to run
the macro.  This makes keyboard macros behave like functions.

Epsilon can instead simply queue the macro's keys, without employing
any loop.  Then when an EEL function says to run a keyboard macro,
Epsilon just records the fact that it's running a macro and
immediately returns to the EEL function.  Later when Epsilon is ready
for more input (perhaps long after the original macro-queuing
function has returned), it begins to use the macro's keys.  An EEL
function can get this behavior by temporarily setting the
macro-runs-immediately variable to zero prior to executing a
keyboard macro.

“macro-runs-immediately

2major-mode

 Vmajor-modemajor-mode‘major-mode: system buffer-specific variable

Default value: 70

This variable holds the current fill column, or right margin.

“margin-right

2mark

 Vmarkmark‘mark: buffer-specific variable
Default value: none

This variable holds the buffer position of the mark.  Several
commands operate on the current region.  The text between the mark
and point specifies the region.

“mark

2mark-to-column

 Vmark-to-columnmark-to-column‘mark-to-column: window-specific variable
Default value: -1

The window-specific mark-to-column variable lets you position
the mark in a part of a window where there are no characters.
Epsilon uses this variable when it displays a region that runs to the
mark's position.  It's normally -1, so Epsilon highlights up to
the actual buffer position of the mark.  If it's non-negative in the
current window, Epsilon highlights up to the specified column
instead.  Epsilon resets mark-to-column to -1 whenever
the buffer changes, or the mark moves from where it was when you last
set mark-to-column.  (Epsilon only checks these conditions
when it redisplays the window, so you can safely move the mark
temporarily.)

“mark-to-column

2mark-unhighlights

 Vmark-unhighlightsmark-unhighlights‘mark-unhighlights: preference variable
Default value: 0

When Epsilon is already displaying a highlighted region,
region-marking commands like mark-rectangle normally change the
type of the region.  For example, mark-rectangle will change a
highlighted line region into a rectangular region.  If this variable
is nonzero, such commands will instead remove the highlighting when
Epsilon is already displaying a highlighted region of the desired
type.  For example, mark-line-region will turn off highlighting
if Epsilon is displaying a line region.  If this variable is zero,
Epsilon does nothing when the correct type of highlighted region is
already being displayed.

“mark-unhighlights

2matchdelim

 Vmatchdelimmatchdelim‘matchdelim: preference variable

This variable holds the amount of space Epsilon is now using for
miscellaneous storage (not including buffer text).

“mem-in-use

2mention-delay

 Vmention-delaymention-delay‘mention-delay: preference variable
Default value: 0

The mention( ) primitive displays its message only after
Epsilon has paused waiting for user input for mention-delay
tenths of a second.  When Epsilon prompts for another key, it often
displays its prompt in this way.

“mention-delay

2menu-bar-flashes

 Vmenu-bar-flashesmenu-bar-flashes‘menu-bar-flashes: preference variable

When you select an item on the menu bar, Epsilon flashes the selected
item.  This variable holds the number of flashes.  (DOS, OS/2, Unix
only.)

“menu-bar-flashes

2menu-bindings

bar.  (DOS, OS/2, Unix only.)

“menu-bindings

2menu-command

 PWIN_MENU_SELECT, textual macro Vmenu-commandmenu-command‘menu-command: system variable
Default value: varies

When the user selects an item from a menu or the tool bar, Epsilon
for Windows returns a special key code,
πMWIN_MENU_SELECT, and sets
the menu_command≈menu_command variable to the name of the
selected command.

“menu-command

2menu-file

2menu-stays-after-click

 Vmenu-stays-after-clickmenu-stays-after-click‘menu-stays-after-click: preference variable
Default value: 1

By default, when you click on the menu bar but release the mouse
without selecting a command, Epsilon leaves the menu displayed until
you click again.  Set the menu-stays-after-click variable to zero
if you want Epsilon to remove the menu when this happens.  (DOS,
OS/2, Unix only.)

Default value: 0

Set the minimal-coloring variable to 1 to tell Epsilon to limit
the amount of coloring it does in order to make code coloring faster.
For C files, Epsilon will color all identifiers, keywords, numbers,
function calls and punctuation the same, using the c-ident color
class for all.  Epsilon will still uniquely color comments,
preprocessor lines, and strings.

followed by a percent sign.

Œ%p Epsilon substitutes the percentage of point through the buffer,
followed by a percent sign.  However, if the bottom of the buffer
appears in the window, Epsilon displays Bot instead (or End if point
is at the very end of the buffer).  Epsilon displays Top if the top
of the buffer appears, and All if the entire buffer is visible.

Œ%s Epsilon substitutes "* " if the buffer's modified

 Vmouse-cursor-charmouse-cursor-char‘mouse-cursor-char: variable
Default value: 0

When Epsilon displays the mouse cursor as a reverse-highlighted
character cell (rather than a graphic arrow symbol), it replaces the
character under the mouse cursor with this character.  If zero,
Epsilon doesn't change the character, but merely highlights it
according to mouse-cursor-attr.  (DOS, OS/2 only.)

2mouse-dbl-selects

 Vmouse-dbl-selectsmouse-dbl-selects‘mouse-dbl-selects: system buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

This variable controls what double-clicking with a mouse button does
in a particular buffer.  If zero, double-clicking selects words.  If
nonzero, Epsilon instead runs the command bound to the ⁄Newline€ key.

“mouse-dbl-selects

2mouse-display

 Vmouse-displaymouse-display‘mouse-display: variable
Default value: none

If nonzero, Epsilon is now displaying a mouse cursor.  When Epsilon
turns on the mouse cursor automatically due to mouse movement, it
sets this variable to 2.

“mouse-display

2mouse-goes-to-tag

 Vmouse-goes-to-tagmouse-goes-to-tag‘mouse-goes-to-tag: buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, double-clicking with the right mouse button on a
subroutine name in this buffer makes Epsilon for DOS or Epsilon for
OS/2 go to the definition of that subroutine using the pluck-tag
command.  (In Epsilon for Windows, use the right mouse button's
context menu to jump to a definition.)

“mouse-goes-to-tag

2mouse-graphic-cursor

 Vmouse-graphic-cursormouse-graphic-cursor‘mouse-graphic-cursor: variable
Default value: varies

If nonzero, Epsilon displays the mouse cursor as a graphic arrow
symbol (DOS only).  If zero, Epsilon uses a reverse-highlighted
character cell for the mouse cursor.  Epsilon sets this variable at
startup based on the operating environment and the presence of the
-kc flag.

This variable contains the horizontal mouse position, in the most
accurate form Epsilon provides.

“mouse-pixel-x

2mouse-pixel-y

This variable contains the vertical mouse position, in the most
accurate form Epsilon provides.

“mouse-pixel-y

2mouse-screen

 Vmouse-screenmouse-screen‘mouse-screen: system variable
Default value: varies

All keys that represent mouse movements or button activity set the
mouse_screen≈mouse_screen variable to indicate which screen
their coordinates refer to.  All tiled windows are on the main
screen, screen 0.  When Epsilon for Windows creates a dialog box
containing one or more Epsilon windows, each Epsilon window has its
own screen number.

“mouse-screen

2mouse-selection-copies

 Vmouse-selection-copiesmouse-selection-copies‘mouse-selection-copies: preference variable
Default value: 2

When you select text with the mouse under Unix, Epsilon copies it to
a kill buffer (and the clipboard), like copy-region does.  Set
this variable to zero to change that behavior.  A value of 0
means selecting text doesn't copy it.  A value of 1 means
selecting text copies it too.  A value of 2, the default, makes
Epsilon copy under Unix, but not in other environments.

“mouse-selection-copies

2mouse-shift

 Vmouse-shiftmouse-shift‘mouse-shift: variable

Bits in this variable indicate which shift keys were depressed at the
time the current mouse event was enqueued.

“mouse-shift

2mouse-x

 Vmouse-xmouse-x‘mouse-x: variable

This variable contains the horizontal mouse position as a column
number on the screen (counting from column zero on the left).

“mouse-y

2must-build-mode

 Vmust-build-modemust-build-mode‘must-build-mode: buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon "precomputes" most of the text of each mode line, so it
doesn't have to figure out what to write each time it updates the
screen.  Setting this variable nonzero warns Epsilon that mode lines
must be rebuilt for all windows displaying this buffer.  Epsilon
resets the variable to zero after every screen update.

“must-build-mode

2narrow-end

 Vnarrow-endnarrow-end‘narrow-end: buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon ignores the last narrow-end characters of the buffer,
neither displaying them nor allowing any other access to them.  But
Epsilon does include them when it writes the buffer to a file, and
counts them in the total size of the buffer.

“narrow-end

2narrow-start

 Vnarrow-startnarrow-start‘narrow-start: buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon ignores the first narrow-start characters of the
buffer, neither displaying them nor allowing any other access to
them.  But Epsilon does include them when it writes the buffer to a
file, and counts them in the total size of the buffer.

“narrow-start

2near-pause

 Vnear-pausenear-pause‘near-pause: preference variable
Default value: 50

The find-delimiter and show-matching-delimiter commands pause
this many hundredths of a second, when they don't have to reposition
the screen to a different part of the buffer in order to show the
matching delimiter.

“near-pause

2need-rebuild-menu

 Vneed-rebuild-menuneed-rebuild-menu‘need-rebuild-menu: system variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon sets this nonzero to indicate that it must rebuild the
contents of its menu bar.

“need-rebuild-menu

2new-buffer-translation-type

 Vnew-buffer-translation-typenew-buffer-translation-type‘new-buffer-translation-type: preference variable
Default value: 5

When you create a new buffer or file, Epsilon sets its
translation-type variable to this variable's value.  The
translation type determines how Epsilon writes or reads a buffer.

A value of 0 (πMFILETYPE_BINARY) makes Epsilon do no line
translation, 1 (πMFILETYPE_MSDOS) makes Epsilon strip
⁄Return€ characters when reading and insert them when writing, 2
(πMFILETYPE_UNIX) makes Epsilon do no line translation, but
indicates that the file contains text, 3 (πMFILETYPE_MAC)
makes Epsilon replace ⁄Return€ characters with ⁄Newline€ characters
when reading, and replace ⁄Newline€ characters with ⁄Return€
characters when writing.

The default, 5 (πMFILETYPE_AUTO), makes Epsilon use the
usual type for this operating system: Unix files under Unix, MS-DOS
files elsewhere.

Also see default-translation-type.

“new-buffer-translation-type

2new-c-comments

 Vnew-c-commentsnew-c-comments‘new-c-comments: preference variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, Epsilon creates a comment in C mode using the // syntax,
rather than the /* */ syntax.  Changing this setting won't affect
buffers already in C mode; restarting Epsilon is one way to make the
change take effect.

“new-c-comments

2new-file-ext

 Vnew-file-extnew-file-ext‘new-file-ext: preference variable
Default value: ".c"

The new-file command creates new buffers with an associated file
name that uses this extension.  Some modes look at the extension of a
buffer's file name to determine how to behave; for example, C mode's
syntax highlighting sets its list of keywords differently for C++
buffers than for C buffers.

“new-file-ext

2new-file-mode

 Vnew-file-modenew-file-mode‘new-file-mode: preference variable
Default value: "c-mode"

The new-file command creates new buffers set to use this mode.
The specified mode-setting command will be run to initialize the
buffer.

“new-file-mode

2new-search-delay

 Vnew-search-delaynew-search-delay‘new-search-delay: preference variable
Default value: 250

In commands that present a list of choices and automatically search
through the list when you type text, Epsilon uses this variable to
determine how long a delay must transpire between keystrokes to
signal the start of new search text.  The delay is in .01 second
units.  For example, if you type "c", then immediately "o",
Epsilon will move to the first entry in the list that starts with
"co".  But if you pause for more than
new-search-delay≈new-search-delay before typing "o", Epsilon
begins a new search string and goes to the first entry that starts
with "o".

Currently only the ¬edit-variables command does this kind of
searching.

“new-search-delay

2normal-cursor

 Vnormal-cursornormal-cursor‘normal-cursor: preference variable
Default value: 98099

This variable holds the shape of the cursor in insert mode (as
opposed to overwrite mode).  It contains a code that specifies the
top and bottom edges of the cursor, such as 3006, which specifies a
cursor that begins on scan line 3 and extends to scan line 6 on a
character box.  The topmost scan line is scan line 0.

Scan lines above 50 in a cursor shape code are interpreted
differently.  A scan line number of 99 indicates the highest-numbered
valid scan line (just below the character), 98 indicates the line
above that, and so forth.  For example, a cursor shape like 1098
produces a cursor that extends from scan line 1 to the next-to-last
scan line, one scan line smaller at top and bottom than a full block
cursor.

See normal-gui-cursor for the Windows or X equivalent.

“normal-cursor

2normal-gui-cursor

 Vnormal-gui-cursornormal-gui-cursor‘normal-gui-cursor: preference variable
Default value: 100002

This variable holds the shape of the caret (the text cursor) in
insert mode (as opposed to overwrite mode) in the Windows and X
versions of Epsilon.  It contains a code that specifies the height
and width of the caret, expressed as a percentage of the size of a
character in pixels.  For example, a width of 100 indicates a caret
just as wide as a character.  Values close to 0 or 100 are absolute
pixel counts, so a width of 98 is two pixels smaller than a
character.  A width of exactly zero means use the default width.  All
measurements are from the top left corner of the character.

In EEL programs, you can use the πMCURSOR_SHAPE( ) macro to
combine the height and width values into the appropriate code; it
simply multiplies the height by 1000 and adds it to the width.  So
the default caret shape of CURSOR_SHAPE(100, 2), which specifies
a height of 100% of the character size and a width of 2 pixels, is
encoded as the value 100,002.  The value 100100 represents a block
cursor.

The X version of Windows can only change the cursor shape if you've
provided an Epsilon.cursorstyle:1 resource.

2only-file-extensions

 Vonly-file-extensionsonly-file-extensions‘only-file-extensions: system variable

If non-null, file name completion only finds files with extensions
from this list.  Each extension must include the . character and
be surrounded by | characters.

 POS_UNIX, textual macro POS_OS2, textual macro POS_DOS, textual macro VopsysMOS_UNIXMOS_OS2MOS_DOSopsys‘opsys: variable
Default value: varies

The opsys≈opsys variable tells which operating system
version of Epsilon is running, using the following macros defined in
codes.h.  OS_DOS, defined as
1, indicates the DOS version or one of the Windows versions is
running.  (See the is-gui variable to distinguish these.)
OS_OS2, defined as 2,
indicates the OS/2 version is running.
OS_UNIX, defined as 3,
indicates the UNIX version is running.

2over-mode

 Vover-modeover-mode‘over-mode: preference buffer-specific variable

If nonzero, typing ordinary characters doesn't insert them between
existing characters, but overwrites the existing characters on the
line.

“over-mode

2overwrite-cursor

 Voverwrite-cursoroverwrite-cursor‘overwrite-cursor: preference variable

versions of Epsilon.  See the description of normal-gui-cursor
for details.

“overwrite-gui-cursor

2paging-centers-window

paging Vpaging-centers-windowpaging-centers-window‘paging-centers-window: preference variable
Default value: 1

If the paging-centers-window≈paging-centers-window
variable is nonzero, the next-page and previous-page commands
will leave point on the center line of the window when you move from
one page to the next.  Set this variable to zero if you want Epsilon
to try to keep point on the same screen line as it pages.  When
paging-centers-window is zero, these commands won't position
point at the start (end) of the buffer when you page up (down) from
the first (last) screenful of the buffer, as they normally do.

“paging-centers-window

2paging-retains-view

 Vpaging-retains-viewpaging-retains-view‘paging-retains-view: variable
Default value: 0

If the paging-retains-view≈paging-retains-view variable is
nonzero when Epsilon displays a buffer in a pop-up window, scrolling
up or down past the end of the buffer won't remove the pop-up window.
Epsilon will ignore attempts to scroll too far.

“paging-retains-view

2path-list-char

 Vpath-list-charpath-list-char‘path-list-char: preference variable

This variable contains the character separating the directory names
in a configuration variable like EPSPATH.

“path-list-char

2path-sep

 Vpath-seppath-sep‘path-sep: preference variable
Default value: '¥', or "/" in Unix

This variable contains the preferred character for separating
directory names.  It is normally "¥".  You may change it to "/" if
you prefer Unix-style file names.  Epsilon will then display file
names with "/" instead of with "¥".  (Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT
currently ignores this setting.  So does Epsilon for DOS when running
under Windows 95/98.  Under Unix, this variable is normally set to
"/" and should not be changed.)

“path-sep

2perl-align-contin-lines

 Vperl-align-contin-linesperl-align-contin-lines‘perl-align-contin-lines: preference variable
Default value: 48

By default, the Perl indenter tries to align continuation lines under
parentheses and other syntactic items on prior lines.  If Epsilon
can't find anything on prior lines to align with, or if aligning the
continuation line would make it start past column
perl-align-contin-lines, Epsilon uses a fixed indentation: two
levels more than the original line, plus the value of the variable
perl-contin-offset (normally zero).

Set this variable to zero if you don't want Epsilon to ever try to
align continuation lines under syntactic features in previous lines.
If zero, Epsilon indents continuation lines by one level (normally
one tab stop), plus the value of the variable perl-contin-offset
(which may be negative).

“perl-align-contin-lines

2perl-auto-show-delim-chars

will search for and highlight the match to this delimiter.

“perl-auto-show-delim-chars

2perl-brace-offset

 Vperl-brace-offsetperl-brace-offset‘perl-brace-offset: preference variable

In Perl mode, Epsilon offsets the indentation of a left brace on its
own line by the value of this variable.  The perl-closeback
variable also helps to control this placement.

“perl-brace-offset

2perl-closeback

 Vperl-closebackperl-closeback‘perl-closeback: preference variable
Default value: 1

If nonzero, Perl mode aligns a right brace character that ends a
block with the line containing the matching left brace character.  If
zero, Perl mode aligns the right brace character with the first
statement inside the block.

“perl-closeback

2perl-contin-offset

 Vperl-contin-offsetperl-contin-offset‘perl-contin-offset: preference variable
Default value: 0

In Perl mode, Epsilon offsets its usual indentation of continuation

that Epsilon can't line up under the text of previous lines.

“perl-contin-offset

2perl-indent

 Vperl-indentperl-indent‘perl-indent: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

Perl mode indents each additional level of nesting by this many
columns.  If the variable is less than or equal to zero, Epsilon uses
the value of tab-size instead.  Set this variable if you want
Epsilon to use one number for displaying tab characters, and a
different number for indenting Perl code.  (Epsilon will indent using
a combination of spaces and tabs, as necessary.)

“perl-indent

2perl-label-indent

 Vperl-label-indentperl-label-indent‘perl-label-indent: preference variable

“perl-label-indent

2perl-tab-override

 Vperl-tab-overrideperl-tab-override‘perl-tab-override: preference variable
Default value: 8

If you want the width of a tab character in Perl mode buffers to be
different than in other buffers, set this variable to the desired
value.  Perl mode will change the buffer's tab size to the specified
number of columns.

“perl-tab-override

2perl-top-braces

 Vperl-top-bracesperl-top-braces‘perl-top-braces: preference variable

Epsilon indents the braces of the top-level block of a function by
the number of characters specified by this variable.  By default,
Epsilon puts such braces at the left margin.

“perl-top-braces

2perl-top-contin

 Vperl-top-continperl-top-contin‘perl-top-contin: preference variable

cannot find any text on previous lines to align the continuation line
beneath.

“perl-top-contin

2perl-top-struct

 Vperl-top-structperl-top-struct‘perl-top-struct: preference variable

Default value: 0

Epsilon only recognizes user attempts to scroll by clicking on the
scroll bar, or to resize the window, when it waits for the first key
in a recursive edit level.  Within an EEL command, when an EEL
command requests a key, Epsilon normally ignores attempts to scroll,
and postpones acting on resize attempts.  An EEL command can set the
permit_window_keys≈permit_window_keys variable to allow
these things to happen immediately, and possibly redraw the screen.
Bits in the variable control these activities: set the
PERMIT_SCROLL_KEY bit to permit immediate scrolling, and set
PERMIT_RESIZE_KEY to permit resizing.  Setting the
PERMIT_WHEEL_KEY bit tells Epsilon to generate a
πMWIN_WHEEL_KEY key event
after scrolling due to a wheel roll on a Microsoft IntelliMouse.

“permit-window-keys

“postscript-auto-show-delim-chars

2preserve-filename-case

 Vpreserve-filename-casepreserve-filename-case‘preserve-filename-case: preference variable
Default value: 0

Set this variable nonzero to tell Epsilon to use the case of file
names exactly as retrieved from the operating system.  By default,
Epsilon changes all-uppercase file names like WIN.INI to lower case
like win.ini, except on case-sensitive file systems.

“preserve-filename-case

2preserve-session

 Vpreserve-sessionpreserve-session‘preserve-session: preference variable
Default value: 6

When this variable is 6, Epsilon writes a session file when it exits,
and reads one when it starts.  Set it to 2 to save the session every
time you exit, but not to restore the session by default.  Set it to
4 to restore the session normally (see the session-always-restore
variable) but not to save the session.  The value 0 does neither.
(The value 1 does both, like 6, for compatibility with previous
versions.)

“preserve-session

2prev-cmd

 Vprev-cmdprev-cmd‘prev-cmd: variable
Default value: none

Some commands behave differently depending on what command preceded
them.  To get this behavior, the command acts differently if
prev-cmd is set to a certain value and sets this-cmd
to that value itself.  Epsilon copies the value in this-cmd
to prev-cmd and then clears this-cmd each time
through the main loop.

“prev-cmd

2print-color-scheme

 Vprint-color-schemeprint-color-scheme‘print-color-scheme: preference variable
Default value: ""

When Epsilon for Windows prints on color printers, you can tell it to
use a different color scheme than it uses for on-screen display.  Put
the name of the color scheme in this variable.  If "", Epsilon
uses the same color scheme as for on-screen display.

“print-color-scheme

2print-destination

 Vprint-destinationRprint-destinationprint-destination‘print-destination: preference variable
Default value: "lpt1"

For DOS or OS/2, Epsilon's printing commands
record the device name of your printer in this variable.  The printer
device name is typically something like LPT1 or COM2.

If the print-destination variable begins with the !
character, Epsilon interprets the remainder of the value as a command
line to execute in order to print a file.  Epsilon substitutes the
file to be printed for any %f sequence in the command line.  For
example, if your system requires you to type "netprint filename" to
print a file, set print-destination to !netprint %f and
Epsilon will run that command, passing it the file name of the
temporary file it generates holding the text to print.  The
print-destination can include any of the file name template
sequences, such as %p for the path to the file to print.  (DOS,
OS/2 only.)

“print-destination

2print-destination-unix

 Vprint-destination-unixprint-destination-unix‘print-destination-unix: preference variable
Default value: "!lpr %f"

Under Unix, this variable tells Epsilon how to print.  If it names a
file, Epsilon will print by simply writing text to that file.  But if
it starts with a ! character (as is usual), Epsilon will
interpret the text after the ! as a command line to execute in
order to print a file.

Epsilon substitutes the file to be printed for any %f sequence in
the command line.  For example, if your system requires you to type
"netprint filename" to print a file, set print-destination to
!netprint %f and Epsilon will run that command, passing it the
file name of the temporary file it generates holding the text to
print.  The print-destination can include any of the file name
template sequences, such as %p for the path to the file to print.

2print-heading

 Vprint-headingprint-heading‘print-heading: preference variable
Default value: 7

Epsilon for Windows prints a heading at the top of each page.  Set
this variable to control what it includes.  The value 1 makes
Epsilon include the file name, 2 makes Epsilon include a page
number, and 4 makes Epsilon include the current date.  You can
add these values together; the default value of 7 includes all
the above items.

2print-in-color

 Vprint-in-colorprint-in-color‘print-in-color: preference variable

By default, Epsilon for Windows will print in color on color
printers, and in black & white on non-color printers.  You can set
the print-in-color variable to 0, if you don't want Epsilon to
ever print in color, or to 2 if you want Epsilon to attempt to
use colors even if the printer doesn't appear to be a color printer.
(Some printers will substitute shades of grey.)  The value 1

Epsilon for Windows will truncate long lines in printed output if
this variable is zero.  Otherwise they will be wrapped to the next
line.

“print-long-lines-wrap

2print-tabs

 Vprint-tabsprint-tabs‘print-tabs: preference variable
Default value: 0

If the print-tabs≈print-tabs variable is zero, Epsilon will make
a copy of any text to be printed and convert tab characters within it
to spaces, prior to sending it to the printer.  If you want Epsilon
to send the text to be printed without converting tabs first, set
this variable to one.

“print-tabs

2process-current-directory

 Vprocess-current-directoryprocess-current-directory‘process-current-directory: system variable
Default value: varies

When you use a concurrent process, Epsilon stores its current
directory in this variable.  Setting this variable switches the
concurrent process to a different current directory.

To set the variable from EEL, use the syntax
process_current_directory = new value;.  Don't use strcpy(),
for example, to modify it.

The Windows 95/98 (and 3.1) versions of Epsilon only transmit current
directory information to or from the process when the process prompts
for input.  The DOS version transmits current directory information
immediately.  Under OS/2, Epsilon can't detect or set the concurrent
process's current directory, so setting this variable has no effect.
Under Unix, Epsilon tries to retrieve the process's current directory
whenever you access this variable, but setting it has no effect.
Under NT, Epsilon tries to detect the process's current directory
using a different method and doesn't use this variable.

When the variable use-process-current-directory is 1, the
default, Epsilon and the subprocess use the same current directory.
In this case, setting this variable is equivalent to changing the
current directory.

“process-current-directory

2process-enter-whole-line

 Vprocess-enter-whole-lineprocess-enter-whole-line‘process-enter-whole-line: preference variable
Default value: 1

If this variable is nonzero, ⁄Enter€ in the concurrent process buffer
moves to the end of the current line before sending it to the
process, but only when in a line that has not yet been sent to the
process.  If the process-enter-whole-line variable is two,
Epsilon copies the current line to the end of the buffer, making it
easier to repeat a command.

“process-enter-whole-line

2process-exit-status

 Vprocess-exit-statusprocess-exit-status‘process-exit-status: system variable
Default value: varies

Epsilon sets this variable when a concurrent process exits, to
indicate its exit code.  Before the process exits, it contains the
value πMPROC_STATUS_RUNNING.

“process-exit-status

2process-output-to-window-bottom

 Vprocess-output-to-window-bottomprocess-output-to-window-bottom‘process-output-to-window-bottom: preference variable
Default value: 1

When output arrives from the concurrent process, Epsilon scrolls the
text so the end of the output appears on the last line of the window,
if possible, like a traditional console window.  Set this variable to
zero to disable this feature.

“process-output-to-window-bottom

2process-tab-size

 Vprocess-tab-sizeprocess-tab-size‘process-tab-size: preference variable
Default value: 8

Epsilon sets the displayed width of ⁄Tab€ characters in the process
buffer to this value.

“process-tab-size

2prompt-with-buffer-directory

 Vprompt-with-buffer-directoryprompt-with-buffer-directory‘prompt-with-buffer-directory: preference variable
Default value: 2

The prompt-with-buffer-directory variable controls how Epsilon
uses the current directory at file prompts.  When this variable is
2, the default, Epsilon inserts the current buffer's directory at
many file prompts.  This makes it easy to select another file in the
same directory.  You can edit the directory name, or you can begin
typing a new absolute pathname right after the inserted pathname.
Epsilon will delete the inserted pathname when it notices your
absolute pathname.  This behavior is similar to Gnu Emacs's.

When prompt-with-buffer-directory is 1, Epsilon temporarily
changes to the current buffer's directory while prompting for a file
name, and interprets file names relative to the current directory.
This behavior is similar to the "pathname.e" extension available
for previous versions of Epsilon.

When prompt-with-buffer-directory is 0, Epsilon doesn't do
anything special at file prompts.  This was Epsilon's default
behavior in previous versions.

“prompt-with-buffer-directory

2push-cmd

 Vpush-cmdpush-cmd‘push-cmd: preference variable
Default value: "make"

This variable holds the default command line for running another
program.  The variable is a template based on the current file name,
so you can set it to automatically operate on the current file.
Epsilon substitutes pieces of the current file name for codes in the
template, as follows (examples are for the file c:¥dos¥read.me):
Œ%p The current file's path (c:¥dos¥).

Œ%b The base part of the current file name (read).

Œ%e The extension of the current file name (.me).

Œ%f The full name of the current file (c:¥dos¥read.me).

Œ%r The name of the file relative to the current directory.
(read.me if the current directory is c:¥dos, dos¥read.me if the
current directory is c:¥, otherwise c:¥dos¥read.me).

Œ%x The full pathname of the directory containing the Epsilon
executable.

Œ%X The full pathname of the directory containing the Epsilon
executable, after converting all Windows 95/98/NT long file names to
their equivalent short name aliases.

“push-cmd

2push-cmd-unix-interactive

 Vpush-cmd-unix-interactivepush-cmd-unix-interactive‘push-cmd-unix-interactive: preference variable
Default value: "xterm &"

When Epsilon for Unix runs as an X program, the push command
executes this command when it needs to start an interactive shell.

“push-cmd-unix-interactive

2readonly-pages

 Vreadonly-pagesreadonly-pages‘readonly-pages: preference variable
Default value: 1

In a read-only buffer you can use the ⁄Space€ and ⁄Backspace€ keys to
page forward and back more conveniently.  Other inserting keys
display an error message.  Set this variable to zero if you want
these keys to display an error message, not page.

Default value: 3

Bits in this variable control Epsilon's action when it reads a
read-only file: ŒROWARN_MSG (1)
Epsilon displays a warning message.

ŒROWARN_BUF_RO
(2) Epsilon sets the buffer read-only.

ŒROWARN_BELL (4)
Epsilon beeps.

ŒROWARN_GREP (8)
Postpone the above actions during multi-file search.



Add these together to get multiple actions.

“readonly-warning

2recall-id

 Vrecall-idrecall-id‘recall-id: system variable
Default value: none

Epsilon's line input subroutines let you recall previous responses to
each prompt.  Epsilon normally keeps track of which responses go with
which prompts by recording the type of response (file name, buffer
name, etc.) and the name of the command that prompted for the text.
A command can tell Epsilon to use a different "handle" for a prompt
by setting the recall-id≈recall-id variable to a string
containing the handle.  For example, if you wrote three new EEL
commands and wanted them to share previous responses, you could
include the line save_var recall_id = "my_responses"; in each
command prior to calling the input function.

“recall-id

2recall-maximum-session

 Vrecall-maximum-sessionrecall-maximum-session‘recall-maximum-session: preference variable
Default value: 40000

Epsilon saves previous responses to all prompts in its session file,
so you don't have to type them in again.  It uses up to
recall-maximum-session≈recall-maximum-session bytes in a session
file for previous responses, discarding the oldest unrecalled
responses when necessary.

“recall-maximum-session

2recall-maximum-size

 Vrecall-maximum-sizerecall-maximum-size‘recall-maximum-size: preference variable
Default value: 40000

Epsilon saves previous responses to all prompts, so you don't have to
type them in again.  It retains up to
recall-maximum-size≈recall-maximum-size bytes of previous
responses, discarding the oldest unrecalled responses when necessary.

“recall-maximum-size

2recognize-password-prompt

 Vrecognize-password-promptrecognize-password-prompt‘recognize-password-prompt: preference variable
Default value: 1

In a Telnet buffer, Epsilon looks for a Password: prompt and
intercepts it to help hide your password.  Set this variable to zero
if you don't want this feature.

“recognize-password-prompt

2recording-suspended

 Vrecording-suspendedrecording-suspended‘recording-suspended: system variable
Default value: 0

The pause-macro command sets this variable nonzero to indicate
that it has suspended recording of a keyboard macro.

“recording-suspended

2regex-first-end

 Vregex-first-endregex-first-end‘regex-first-end: preference variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, Epsilon's standard regular expression searching commands
find the match of the pattern that ends first, rather than the one
that begins first.

“regex-first-end

2regex-shortest

 Vregex-shortestregex-shortest‘regex-shortest: preference variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, Epsilon's standard regular expression searching commands

2reindent-after-c-yank

 Vreindent-after-c-yankreindent-after-c-yank‘reindent-after-c-yank: preference variable
Default value: 10000

When you yank text into a buffer in C mode, Epsilon automatically
reindents it.  This is similar to the "smart paste" feature in some
other editors.  Epsilon won't automatically reindent very large
blocks of text.  This variable specifies the size in characters of
the largest block that should automatically be reindented.  Set it to
0 to disable automatic reindent in C mode, or -1 to reindent
all text yanked in C mode.

“reindent-after-c-yank

2reindent-after-perl-yank

 Vreindent-after-perl-yankreindent-after-perl-yank‘reindent-after-perl-yank: preference variable
Default value: 0

When you yank text into a buffer in Perl mode, Epsilon automatically
reindents it.  This is similar to the "smart paste" feature in some
other editors.  Epsilon won't automatically reindent very large
blocks of text.  This variable specifies the size in characters of
the largest block that should automatically be reindented.  Set it to
0 to disable automatic reindent in Perl mode, or -1 to
reindent all text yanked in Perl mode.

“reindent-after-perl-yank

2reindent-after-yank

 Vreindent-after-yankreindent-after-yank‘reindent-after-yank: preference variable
Default value: 0

This variable controls whether Epsilon automatically reindents blocks
of text you yank into the current buffer.  This is similar to the
"smart paste" feature in some other editors.  This variable
specifies the size in characters of the largest block that should
automatically be reindented.  A value of 0 disables automatic
reindent in this buffer, and -1 removes any size limitation.
Mode-specific variables like reindent-after-c-yank take
precedence over this variable.

“reindent-after-yank

2reindent-c-comments

 Vreindent-c-commentsreindent-c-comments‘reindent-c-comments: preference variable
Default value: 1

This variable controls how Epsilon indents lines that start a block
comment (those that begin with "/*") and lines that start inside
a block comment.  If 0, Epsilon never changes the indentation of
these lines in commands like indent-region.  If 1, Epsilon
reindents these lines, except when yanking a block of text and
automatically reindenting it.  If 2, Epsilon reindents in all
cases.

2resize-menu-list

 Vresize-menu-listresize-menu-list‘resize-menu-list: system variable
Default value: 0

An EEL completion function can set this variable nonzero to indicate
that if the user tries to list possible completion choices, the
window displaying the choices should be widened if necessary to fit
the widest choice.  This variable has no effect on Epsilon windows
within GUI dialogs.

“resize-menu-list

2restart-concurrent

 Vrestart-concurrentrestart-concurrent‘restart-concurrent: preference variable
Default value: 1

When the push, make, or compile-buffer commands exit from
a concurrent process to run a command non-concurrently, they will
restart the concurrent process once the command finishes.  Set
restart-concurrent to zero if you don't want Epsilon to restart
the concurrent process in this case.

“restart-concurrent

2restore-blinking-on-exit

 Vrestore-blinking-on-exitrestore-blinking-on-exit‘restore-blinking-on-exit: preference variable
Default value: 0

Under DOS and OS/2, Epsilon normally sets the video mode on EGA/VGA
systems to display bright backgrounds in place of blinking
characters.  Set restore-blinking-on-exit nonzero if you want
Epsilon to reset back to blinking characters when it exits.

“restore-blinking-on-exit

2restore-color-on-exit

 Vrestore-color-on-exitrestore-color-on-exit‘restore-color-on-exit: preference variable
Default value: 1

If nonzero, Epsilon for DOS tries to restore the screen color when
you exit.  If zero (and under OS/2), Epsilon tries to set the color
to the after-exiting color class, as specified with the set-color
command.  (Sometimes the operating system environment overrides this
and forces a particular color.  DOS, OS/2 only.)

“restore-color-on-exit

2resynch-match-chars

 Vresynch-match-charsresynch-match-chars‘resynch-match-chars: preference variable
Default value: 15

If you invoke compare-windows again immediately after it has
found a difference, the command will try to resynchronize the windows
by moving forward in each window until it finds a match of at least
resynch-match-chars characters.

“resynch-match-chars

2return-raw-buttons

 Vreturn-raw-buttonsreturn-raw-buttons‘return-raw-buttons: system variable
Default value: 0

If you click a button in a dialog under Epsilon for Windows, Epsilon
represents the input with an ordinary key value, such as ⁄Enter€ when
you click an Ok button.  An EEL program can temporarily set this
variable to a nonzero value to retrieve button presses as distinct
keys.  All buttons will then appear with the key code
πMWIN_BUTTON.  Use the key-is-button variable to
distinguish one button from another.

“return-raw-buttons

2rev-search-key

 Vrev-search-keyrev-search-key‘rev-search-key: preference variable

2scroll-at-end

 Vscroll-at-endscroll-at-end‘scroll-at-end: preference variable
Default value: 1

When you move past the top or bottom edge of the window via the
up-line or down-line commands, Epsilon scrolls the screen by
this many lines.  If scroll-at-end is zero, Epsilon instead
centers the new line in the window.

“scroll-at-end

2scroll-bar-type

 Vscroll-bar-typescroll-bar-type‘scroll-bar-type: preference variable
Default value: 1

Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT can display two types of scroll bars.
By default scroll-bar-type is 1, and Epsilon uses a
line-based approach, with a "thumb" size that varies to reflect the
number of lines visible in the window relative to the number of lines
in the buffer.  On extremely large buffers, this could be slow, so
you can set the variable to 0 and Epsilon will use a fixed-size
thumb as in previous versions.

“scroll-bar-type

2scroll-init-delay

 Vsearch-in-menusearch-in-menu‘search-in-menu: preference variable
Default value: 0

This variable controls what Epsilon does when you press "?" during
completion and then continue typing a response.  If zero, Epsilon
moves from the pop-up list of responses back to the prompt area, and
editing keys like ⁄Left€ navigate in the response.  If nonzero,
Epsilon moves in the pop-up menu of names to the first name that
matches what you've typed, and stays in the pop-up window.  (If it
can't find a match, Epsilon moves back to the prompt as before.)

“search-in-menu

2search-wraps

 Vsearch-wrapssearch-wraps‘search-wraps: preference variable
Default value: 1

By default, when an incremental search fails, pressing Ctrl-S or
Ctrl-R to continue the search in the same direction makes Epsilon
wrap to the other end of the buffer and continue searching from
there.  Set this variable to zero to disable this behavior.

“search-wraps

previous session when no files are specified.

“session-always-restore

2session-default-directory

 Vsession-default-directorysession-default-directory‘session-default-directory: preference variable
Default value: none

If Epsilon finds no session file by searching the current directory
tree, it uses a session file in this directory.  But if
session-default-directory is empty, Epsilon uses the EPSPATH
configuration variable, if there is one, or the root directory.

“session-default-directory

2session-file-name

 Vsession-file-namesession-file-name‘session-file-name: preference variable
Default value: none

If this variable is nonempty, it provides the name of the session

Epsilon can search for files by that name in the current directory
hierarchy.

“session-file-name

2session-restore-directory

 Vsession-restore-directorysession-restore-directory‘session-restore-directory: preference variable
Default value: 2

When Epsilon reads a session file, it can restore the current
directory named in that file.  If session-restore-directory is 1,
it always does this.  If 0, it never restores the current directory.
If 2, the default, it restores the current directory only if the -w1
flag was specified.

2session-restore-files

 Vsession-restore-filessession-restore-files‘session-restore-files: preference variable
Default value: 1

If 0, when Epsilon restores a session, it won't load any files
named in the session, only settings like previous search strings and
command history.  If 1, Epsilon will restore previous files as
well as other settings.  If 2, Epsilon will restore previous
files only if there were no files specified on Epsilon's command line.

“session-restore-files

2session-restore-max-files

 Vsession-restore-max-filessession-restore-max-files‘session-restore-max-files: preference variable
Default value: 30

When Epsilon restores a session, it will only reload up to this
number of files.  Files are prioritized by time of access in Epsilon,
so Epsilon by default restores the 30 files you've most recently
edited.

“session-restore-max-files

2session-tree-root

 Vsession-tree-rootsession-tree-root‘session-tree-root: preference variable
Default value: "NONE"

If nonempty, when Epsilon searches for a session file in the current
directory tree, it only examines directories that are children of
this directory.  For example, if session-tree-root holds
¥joe¥proj, and the current directory is ¥joe¥proj¥src, Epsilon will
search in ¥joe¥proj¥src, then ¥joe¥proj, for a session file.  If the
current directory is ¥joe¥misc, on the other hand, Epsilon won't
search at all (since ¥joe¥misc isn't a child of ¥joe¥proj), but will
use the rules in the previous paragraph.  By default,
session-tree-root is set to an impossible absolute pathname, so
searching is disabled.

2shell-shrinks

 Vshell-shrinksshell-shrinks‘shell-shrinks: preference variable
Default value: 1

Under DOS, this variable helps to determine the amount of memory
available to any subprocess you run.  If zero, Epsilon and the
process share the available memory.  If nonzero, Epsilon unloads
itself from memory until you exit from the process, leaving only a
small section of itself behind.  When your program exits, Epsilon
reloads itself, leaving you in exactly the same state as before the
shrinking occurred.

“shell-shrinks

2shell-tab-override

following sequences, and Epsilon will substitute the indicated value
for that sequence: Œ%c Epsilon substitutes the
current column number, counting columns from 0.

Œ%C Epsilon substitutes the current column number, counting columns
from 1.

Œ%d Epsilon substitutes the current display column, with a <
before it, and a space after.  However, if the display column has a
value of 0 (meaning horizontal scrolling is enabled, but the
window has not been scrolled), or -1 (meaning the window wraps
long lines), Epsilon substitutes nothing.

Œ%D Epsilon substitutes the current display column, but if the
display column is -1, Epsilon substitutes nothing.

Œ%f The name of the current function (in buffers where Epsilon can
determine this).

Œ%l Epsilon substitutes the current line number.

Œ%m Epsilon substitutes the text " More ", but only if
characters exist past the end of the window.  If the last character
in the buffer appears in the window, Epsilon substitutes nothing.

Œ%P Epsilon substitutes the percentage of point through the buffer,
followed by a percent sign.

Œ%p Epsilon substitutes the percentage of point through the buffer,
followed by a percent sign.  However, if the bottom of the buffer
appears in the window, Epsilon displays Bot instead (or End if point
is at the very end of the buffer).  Epsilon displays Top if the top
of the buffer appears, and All if the entire buffer is visible.

Œ%s Epsilon substitutes "* " if the buffer's modified
flag has a nonzero value, otherwise nothing.

Œ%S Epsilon substitutes "*" if the buffer's modified
flag has a nonzero value, otherwise nothing.

Œ%h Epsilon substitutes the current hour in the range 1 to 12.

Œ%H Epsilon substitutes the current hour in military time in the
range 0 to 23.

Œ%n Epsilon substitutes the current minute in the range 0 to 59.

Œ%e Epsilon substitutes the current second in the range 0 to 59.

Œ%a Epsilon substitutes "am" or "pm" as appropriate.

ŒNote: For the current time, use a sequence like %2h:%02n %a
for "3:45 pm" or %02H:%02n:%02e for "15:45:21".

Œ%% Epsilon substitutes a literal "%" character.  

For any numeric substitution, you may include a number between the %
and the letter code, giving the field width: the minimum number of
characters to print.  You can use the same kinds of field width
specifiers as C's printf() function.  The sequence %4c
expands to "⁄Space€⁄Space€⁄Space€9", %04c expands to
"0009", and %-4c expands to "9⁄Space€⁄Space€⁄Space€".

“show-when-idle

2show-when-idle-column

 Vshow-when-idle-columnshow-when-idle-column‘show-when-idle-column: preference variable
Default value: 48

You can set Epsilon to display text in the echo area whenever it's
idle.  Epsilon positions the text
show-when-idle-column≈show-when-idle-column columns from the
left edge of the screen.  Set this variable to a negative number to
make Epsilon count columns from the right edge of the screen instead.
For example, set show-when-idle-column to -10 to make Epsilon
position the text 10 columns from the right edge.

“show-when-idle-column

2sort-case-fold

 Vsort-case-foldsort-case-fold‘sort-case-fold: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 2

When comparing lines of text during sorting, Epsilon folds lower case
letters to upper case before comparison, if the sort-case-fold
variable is 1.  If the sort-case-fold variable is 0, Epsilon
compares characters as-is.  If sort-case-fold is 2, Epsilon
instead folds characters only if the case-fold variable is
nonzero.

“sort-case-fold

version of Epsilon.

“state-extension

2state-file-backup-name

 Vstate-file-backup-namestate-file-backup-name‘state-file-backup-name: preference variable
Default value: "%pebackup%e"

When you write a new state file, Epsilon makes a copy of the old one
if the variable want-state-file-backups is nonzero.  Epsilon
constructs the backup file name from the original using the file name
template in this variable.

“state-file-backup-name

2system-window

 Vsystem-windowsystem-window‘system-window: system window-specific variable

2tag-ask-before-retagging

 Vtag-ask-before-retaggingtag-ask-before-retagging‘tag-ask-before-retagging: preference variable
Default value: 0

If zero, when a tag's line has changed within a file, Epsilon retags
the file automatically and then searches again.  Similarly, when
Epsilon can't find a tag at all, it tries tagging the current file.
If nonzero, Epsilon asks before doing either of these things.

“tag-ask-before-retagging

2tag-batch-mode

 Vtag-batch-modetag-batch-mode‘tag-batch-mode: system variable
Default value: 0

Epsilon's tag facility uses this variable to decide if it should
report an error immediately, or just log it to a buffer.

“tag-batch-mode

2tag-by-text

 Vtag-by-texttag-by-text‘tag-by-text: preference variable
Default value: 1

If nonzero, Epsilon includes the entire line that defined a tag in
the tag file, so it can search for the line when the buffer has been
modified since tagging.  If zero, Epsilon only includes the offset,
saving space in the tag file for files that rarely change.

“tag-by-text

2tag-case-sensitive

 Vtag-case-sensitivetag-case-sensitive‘tag-case-sensitive: preference variable
Default value: 0

Set this variable nonzero if you want tagging to consider MAIN, Main
and main to be distinct tags.  By default, typing main will find any
of these.

“tag-case-sensitive

2tag-declarations

 Vtag-declarationstag-declarations‘tag-declarations: preference variable
Default value: 0

The tag-declarations variable lets you set whether the tagger
will tag function or variable declarations (as opposed to
definitions, which Epsilon always tags).  If zero (the default),
Epsilon only tags definitions.  If one, Epsilon tags function
declarations as well.  If two, Epsilon tags variable declarations
(which use the extern keyword).  If three, Epsilon tags both
types of declarations.  You may wish to use this setting to tag the
.h header files of library functions.

“tag-declarations

2tag-extern-decl

 Vtag-extern-decltag-extern-decl‘tag-extern-decl: system variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, Epsilon stores relative pathnames in the tag file
whenever it can.  If zero, Epsilon uses only absolute pathnames.

“tag-relative

2tag-show-percent

 Vtag-show-percenttag-show-percent‘tag-show-percent: system variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, Epsilon displays a percentage status report while tagging
instead of mentioning each tag it finds.  Commands that use tagging
to parse a buffer without really generating tags can set this.

“tag-show-percent

2tex-auto-fill-mode

 Vtex-auto-fill-modetex-auto-fill-mode‘tex-auto-fill-mode: variable
Default value: 1

If nonzero, Epsilon breaks long lines in TeX/LaTeX files using

 Vtex-auto-show-delim-charstex-auto-show-delim-chars‘tex-auto-show-delim-chars: variable
Default value: "µ[]∂"

This variable holds the set of delimiter characters that should
trigger Epsilon's auto-show-delimiters feature in TeX mode.  Epsilon
will search for and highlight the match to this delimiter.

“tex-auto-show-delim-chars

2tex-environment-name

 Vtex-environment-nametex-environment-name‘tex-environment-name: variable
Default value: "document"

The tex-environment command uses this variable to hold the name
of the last environment you inserted in TeX mode.

“tex-environment-name

2tex-force-latex

 Vtex-force-latextex-force-latex‘tex-force-latex: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 1

Some TeX mode commands are slightly different in LaTeX than in pure
TeX.  Set tex-force-latex to 1 if all your documents are
LaTeX, 0 if all your documents are TeX, or 2 if Epsilon
should determine this on a document-by-document basis.  In that case,
Epsilon will assume a document is LaTeX if it contains a
¥beginµdocument∂ statement or if it's in a file with an .ltx
extension.

“tex-force-latex

2tex-look-back

 Vtex-look-backtex-look-back‘tex-look-back: preference variable
Default value: 20000

TeX syntax highlighting sometimes needs to look back in the buffer to
locate the start of a paragraph.  Long stretches of text without
paragraph breaks can make it slow.  Set this variable lower if you
want Epsilon to give up sooner and incorrectly color some rare cases.

“tex-look-back

2tex-paragraphs

 Vtex-paragraphstex-paragraphs‘tex-paragraphs: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, then Epsilon will not consider as part of a paragraph any
sequence of lines that each start with at sign or period, if that
sequence appears next to a blank line.  And lines starting with
¥begin or ¥end will also delimit paragraphs.

“tex-paragraphs

2tex-save-new-environments

 Vtex-save-new-environmentstex-save-new-environments‘tex-save-new-environments: preference variable
Default value: 0

The tex-environment command lets you easily create a new
environment, inserting begin/end pairs.  When it prompts for an
environment name, you can type the name of a new environment, and
Epsilon will remember it for the rest of the editing session,
offering it for completion.  Set this variable nonzero and Epsilon
will also save the new environment name for future sessions.

“tex-save-new-environments

2text-color

 Vtext-colortext-color‘text-color: window-specific variable
Default value: 0

This variable contains the color class of normal text in the current
window.

“text-color

2this-cmd

 Vthis-cmdthis-cmd‘this-cmd: variable
Default value: none

Some commands behave differently depending on what command preceded
them.  To get this behavior, the command acts differently if
prev-cmd is set to a certain value and sets this-cmd
to that value itself.  Epsilon copies the value in this-cmd
to prev-cmd and then clears this-cmd each time
through the main loop.

“this-cmd

2tiled-border

 Vtiled-bordertiled-border‘tiled-border: preference variable
Default value: 0xAA

This variable holds the border codes Epsilon uses for putting borders
at the edges of a tiled window.

“tiled-border

2tiled-scroll-bar

 Vtiled-scroll-bartiled-scroll-bar‘tiled-scroll-bar: system variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, Epsilon constantly displays a scroll bar on tiled
windows.  Set this with the toggle-scroll-bar command.

“tiled-scroll-bar

2topindent

 Vtopindenttopindent‘topindent: preference variable
Default value: 1

If nonzero, Epsilon indents top-level statements in a function.  If
zero, Epsilon keeps such statements at the left margin.

“topindent

2translation-type

 Vtranslation-typetranslation-type‘translation-type: buffer-specific variable
Default value: 5

Epsilon uses this variable to record the type of line translation
used by the current buffer.  The set-line-translate command sets
this variable.  To read a new file in a mode other than the default,
type Ctrl-U Ctrl-X Ctrl-F to run the find-file command with a
numeric argument.

“translation-type

2type-point

 Vtype-pointtype-point‘type-point: buffer-specific variable
Default value: none

This variable holds the position within the process buffer where
Epsilon inserts new text from the process.  Epsilon retrieves any
text after the type point and sends it as input to the process.  The
variable serves a similar purpose in Telnet buffers and buffers
involved in FTP transfers.

“type-point

2typing-deletes-highlight

 Vtyping-deletes-highlighttyping-deletes-highlight‘typing-deletes-highlight: preference variable
Default value: 1

If this variable is nonzero, pressing a self-inserting key like "j"
while text is highlighted deletes the highlighted selection,
replacing it with the key.  Pressing ⁄Backspace€ simply deletes the
text.

If you set this variable to zero, you may wish to set the
insert-default-response variable to zero also.  Then Epsilon
won't automatically insert and highlight your previous response at
various prompts.

“typing-deletes-highlight

2undo-flag

 Vundo-flagundo-flag‘undo-flag: buffer-specific variable
Default value: none

In addition to buffer changes and movements, Epsilon can record other
information in its list of undoable operations.  Each time you set
this variable, Epsilon inserts a "flag" in its undo list with the
particular value you specify.  When Epsilon is undoing or redoing and
encounters a flag, it immediately ends the current group of undo
operations, returns a special code, and puts the value of the flag it
encountered back into the undo_flag variable.

“undo-flag

2undo-keeps-narrowing

 Vundo-keeps-narrowingundo-keeps-narrowing‘undo-keeps-narrowing: system buffer-specific variable
Default value: 0

If you use the narrow-to-region command to hide part of the
buffer, and then use the undo command to undo a change in a
hidden part of the buffer, undo removes the narrowing.  Some
modes set this variable nonzero to prevent that behavior.

“undo-keeps-narrowing

2undo-size

 Vundo-sizeundo-size‘undo-size: preference buffer-specific variable
Default value: 500000

Epsilon retains at most this many characters of deleted or changed
text in this buffer's undo information.

“undo-size

2ungot-key

 Vungot-keyungot-key‘ungot-key: variable
Default value: -1

If this variable is set to some value other than its usual value of
-1, Epsilon uses that value when it next tries to read a key and
sets ungot-key to -1 again.

“ungot-key

2use-default

 Vuse-defaultuse-default‘use-default: system variable
Default value: 0

If nonzero, every time Epsilon refers to a buffer- or window-specific
variable, it uses the default value instead of the current value.

“use-default

2use-process-current-directory

 Vuse-process-current-directoryuse-process-current-directory‘use-process-current-directory: preference variable
Default value: 1

If the use-process-current-directory variable is 1, the default,
Epsilon for Windows 95/98 (or Windows 3.1) and its concurrent process
will share a common current directory.  Changing the current
directory in Epsilon will change the current directory for the
process, and vice versa.  If the variable is 0, Epsilon and its
concurrent process will use independent current directories.

This variable only modifies the behavior of Epsilon for Windows.
Epsilon for DOS always shares the current directory with its process.
Under OS/2, Epsilon always uses independent current directories.
Under NT and Unix, Epsilon tries to retrieve the process's current
directory and use it as the default directory for the process buffer,
but it doesn't affect Epsilon's current directory (set with Alt-x
cd), and Epsilon never tries to set the process's current
directory.

“use-process-current-directory

2user-abort

 Vuser-abortuser-abort‘user-abort: variable

 Vversioned-file-stringversioned-file-string‘versioned-file-string: system variable
Default value: varies

This variable holds Epsilon's version number, formatted so that it
can be part of a directory name.  Epsilon for Unix looks for its
configuration files in a directory whose name is built from this
string; it also checks this against the variable eel-version to
detect version mismatches between an Epsilon executable and its state
file commands.

“versioned-file-string

In Epsilon for Windows, some commands that prompt for files can use
the Windows Common File Dialog.  By default, these commands use the
dialog if you invoke them from the menu or tool bar, but not if you
invoke them from the keyboard using their bindings.  Set this
variable to 2 if you want Epsilon to use the Common File Dialog
whenever it can.  Set the variable to 0 to prevent Epsilon from
ever using this dialog.  The default value of 1 produces the

default-word.)

“word-pattern

1Changing Epsilon

”CmodifEpsilon provides several ways for you to change its behavior.
Some commands enable you to make simple changes.
For example,
set-fill-column can change the width of filled lines of text.
Commands like bind-to-key and create-prefix-command can
move commands around on the keyboard, and using keyboard macros, you
can build simple new commands.  The remaining chapters of the manual
describe how to use the Epsilon Extension Language, EEL, to make more
sophisticated commands and to modify existing commands.

Unless you save them, all these types of changes go away when you
exit, and you must reload them the next time you run Epsilon.  As
you'll see in the following chapters, extension language changes
always exist in a bytecode file before they exist in Epsilon, so you could
load the file again (with the load-bytes command) to restore
changes made with the extension language.  You can also save
bindings and macros in a command file (using the
insert-binding and insert-macro commands), so with
some care you could preserve these types of changes from session to
session via command files.  However, Epsilon provides an easier way to
preserve changes.

When it starts, Epsilon reads a state file named epsilon.sta
containing all of Epsilon's initial commands, variables, and
bindings.  You can change the set of initial commands by generating a
new state file with the Epsilon command ¬write-state on
Ctrl-F3.

When Epsilon starts, it usually looks for a state file named
epsilon.sta.  Alternatively, you can use Epsilon's -s flag to
make Epsilon load its state from some other file.  For example,
"epsilon -sfilename" loads its commands from the file
filename.sta.

If you have just a few simple changes to make to Epsilon, you can make
them permanent without learning EEL, the extension language.  Simply
start Epsilon, make your changes (bind some keys, set a variable,
define some macros) and use the write-state command to put the
changes in epsilon.sta.  Your customizations will take effect
each time you run Epsilon.

Once you've learned a little EEL, you may want to modify some of
Epsilon's built-in commands.  We recommend that you keep your
modifications to Epsilon in files other than the standard distributed
source files.  That way, when you get an update of Epsilon, you will
find it easy to recompile your changes without accidentally
loading in old versions of some of the standard functions.

RchangesYou may find it handy to have a file that loads your changes into a
fresh Epsilon, then writes the new state file automatically.  The
following simple EEL file, which we'll call changes.e, uses features
described in later chapters to do just that:

Ω#include "eel.h"  /* load standard definitions */≤≤when_loading()    /* execute this file when loaded */≤{≤    want_bell = 0;            /* turn off the bell */≤    kill_buffers = 6;            /* make 6 kill buffers */≤    load_commands("mycmds");  /* load my new cmnds */≤    do_save_state("epsilon"); /* save these changes */≤}≤æ≤
Each time you get an update of Epsilon, you can compile this program
(type eel changes outside of Epsilon) and start Epsilon with its
new state file (type epsilon).  Then when you load this file
(type F3 changes ⁄Enter€ to Epsilon), Epsilon will make all
your changes in the updated version and automatically save them for
next time.

You can change most variables as in the example above.  Some
variables, however, have a separate value for each buffer.  Consider,
for example, the tab size (which corresponds to the value of the
tab-size variable).  This variable's value can potentially
change from buffer to buffer.  We call this a buffer-specific
variable.  Buffer-specific variables have one value for each buffer
plus a special value called the default value.  The default value
specifies the value for the variable in a newly created buffer.  A
state file stores only the default value of a buffer-specific
variable.

Thus, to change the tab size permanently, you must change
tab_size's default value.  You can use the set-variable
command to make the change, or an EEL program.  The following version
of changes.e sets the default tab size to 5.

Ω#include "eel.h"  /* load standard definitions */≤≤when_loading()    /* execute this file when loaded */≤{≤    tab_size.default = 5;     /* set default value  */≤    load_commands("mycmds");  /* load my new cmnds */≤    do_save_state("epsilon"); /* save these changes */≤}≤æ≤
You cannot redefine a function during that function's execution.
Thus, changing the ¬load-bytes command, for example, would
seem to require writing a different command with the same
functionality, and using each to load a new version of the other.
You don't have to do this, however.  Using the -b flag, you can
load an entire system into Epsilon from bytecode files, not reading a
state file at all.  Epsilon does not execute any EEL functions while
loading commands with the -b flag, so you can redefine any
function using this technique.

make utility program
makefile fileTo use this technique, first compile all the files that make up
Epsilon.  If you have a "make" utility
program, you can use the makefile included with
Epsilon to do this.  Then start Epsilon with the command epsilon
-b.  This loads the single bytecode file epsilon.b, which
automatically loads all the others.

You can then save the entire system in a state file using the
write-state command.  You may sometimes find it more
convenient to modify the source files and build a new system, instead
of using changes.e as outlined previously (for example, when you have
made many changes to commands).

2Epsilon Extension Language Features

extension languageextensions vs. macrosmacros vs. extensions”Cintroeel

The Epsilon Extension Language (EEL) allows you to write
your own commands and greatly modify and customize the editor to suit
your style.  EEL provides a great deal of power.  We used
it to write all of Epsilon's commands.
You can use it to write new commands, or to modify
the ones that we provide.

We call EEL an ªextension languageº because you use it to extend
the editor.  Some people call such things ªmacro languagesº.  We
use the term "macro" to refer to the keyboard macros you can create
in Epsilon, or to EEL's C-like textual macros, but not to the
commands or extensions you write in EEL.

EEL has quite a few features that most extension languages don't:

 Block structure, with a syntax resembling the C programming
language.

 Full flow control: if, while, for, do, switch and
goto.  Additionally, EEL has a non-local goto facility provided by
setjmp and longjmp.

 Complete set of data types, including integers, arrays,
structures, and pointers.  In addition, you may define new
data types and allocate data objects dynamically.

 Subroutines with parameter passing.  You may invoke subroutines
recursively, and can designate any subroutine a command.

 Rich set of arithmetic and logical operators.  EEL has all
the operators of the C programming language.

 A powerful set of primitives.  We wrote all of Epsilon's
commands in EEL.

 Global variables accessible everywhere, and local variables
accessible only in the current routine.  EEL also has
buffer-specific variables that change from buffer to buffer, and
window-specific variables that have a different value in each
window.



source level tracing
debuggerexecution profilerIn addition, the runtime system provides a ªsource level tracing
debuggerº, and an ªexecution profilerº. (The Windows 3.1 version
does not provide the execution profiler).

Epsilon's source subdirectory contains the EEL source code to all
Epsilon's commands.  You may find it helpful to look at this source
code when learning the extension language.  Even after you've become
a proficient EEL programmer, you probably will find yourself
referring to the source code when writing your own extensions, to see
how a particular command accomplishes some task.

2EEL Tutorial

 Csimple-insert-file, commandsimple-insert-fileReeltutorialThis section will take you step by step through
the process of creating a new command using EEL.  You will learn
how to use the EEL compiler, a few control structures and data types,
and a few primitive operations.  Most importantly, this section will
teach you the mechanics of writing extensions in EEL.

As our example, we will write a simplified version of the
insert-file command called simple-insert-file.  It
will ask for the name of a file, and insert the contents of the file
before point in the current buffer.  We will write it a few lines at
a time, each time having the command do more until the whole command
works.  When you write EEL routines, you may find this the way to go.
This method allows you to debug small sections of code.

Start Epsilon in a directory where you want to create the files for
this tutorial. Using the find-file command (Ctrl-X Ctrl-F), create
a file with the name "learn.e".

To write an extension, you: write the source code,
compile the source code, load the compiled code, then
run the command.

First, we write the source code.  Type the following into the buffer
and save it:

Ω#include "eel.h"        /* standard definitions */≤≤command simple_insert_file()≤{≤    char inserted_file[FNAMELEN];≤≤    get_file(inserted_file, "Insert file", "");≤    say("You typed file name ≥s", inserted_file);≤}≤æ≤
Let's look at what the source code says.  The first line includes the
text of the file "eel.h" into this program, as though you had
typed it yourself at that point.

Comments go between /* and */.

The file "eel.h" defines some system-wide constants, and a few global
variables.  Always include it at the beginning of your extension
files.

The line

Ωcommand simple_insert_file()æ

says to define a command
with the name simple_insert_file.  The empty parentheses mean
that this function takes no parameters.  The left brace on the next
line and the right brace at the end of the file delimit the text of
the command.

Each command or subroutine begins with a sequence of local variable
declarations.  Our command has one, the line

ΩMFNAMELEN PFNAMELEN, textual macrochar inserted_file[FNAMELEN];æ

which declares an array of characters called
inserted_file.  The array has a length of FNAMELEN.  The
constant FNAMELEN (defined in eel.h) may vary from one
operating system to another.  It specifies the maximum file name
length, including the directory name.  The semicolon at the end of
the line terminates the declaration.

The next statement

Ωget_file(inserted_file, "Insert file", "");æ

calls the built-in subroutine get_file( ).  This
primitive takes three parameters: a character array to store the user's
typed-in file name, a string with which to prompt the user, and a value
to offer as a default.  In this case, the Epsilon
will prompt the user with the text between the double quotes (with a colon
stuck on the end).  We call a sequence of characters between double quotes
a ªstring constantº.

When the user invokes this command,
the prompt string appears in
the echo area.  Epsilon then waits for the user to enter a string,
which it copies to the character array.
While typing in
the file name, the user
may use Epsilon's file name completion and querying
facility.  This routine returns when the user hits the ⁄Enter€ key.

The next statement,

Ωsay("You typed file name %s", inserted_file);æ

prints in the echo area what file name the user typed in.  The
primitive say( ) takes one or more arguments.  The first argument
acts as a template, specifying what to print out.  The "%s" in the
above format string says to interpret the next argument as a
character array (or a string), and to print that instead of the
"%s".  In this case, for the second argument we provided
inserted_file, which holds the name of the file obtained in the
previous statement.

For example, say the user types the file name "foo.bar", followed
by ⁄Enter€.  The character array inserted_file would have
the characters "foo.bar" in it when the get_file( ) primitive
returns.  Then the second statement would print out

ΩYou typed file name foo.baræ

in the echo area.

One way to get this command into Epsilon is to run the EEL compiler
to compile the source code into a form Epsilon can interpret, called
a bytecode file.  EEL source files end in ".e", and the compiler
generates a file of compiled binary object code that ends in ".b".
After you do that, you can load the .b file using the
load-bytes command.

But an easier way that combines these steps is to use Epsilon's
compile-buffer command on Alt-F3.  This command invokes the
EEL compiler, as if you typed

Ωeel »filename…æ

where »filename… is the name of the file you want to
compile, and then (if there are no errors) loads the resulting
bytecode file.  You should get the message "learn.b compiled and
loaded." in the echo area.

Now that you've compiled and loaded learn.b, Epsilon knows about a
command named simple-insert-file.  Epsilon translates the
underscores of command names to hyphens, so as to avoid conflicts
with the arithmetic minus sign in the source text.  So the name
simple_insert_file in the eel source code defines
simple-insert-file at command level.

Go ahead and invoke the command simple-insert-file.  The prompt

ΩInsert file: æ

appears in the echo area.  Type in a file
name now.  You can use all Epsilon's completion and querying
facilities.  If you press "?", you will get a list of all the
files.  If you type "foo?", you will get a list
of all the files that start with "foo".  ⁄Esc€ and ⁄Space€
completion work.  You can abort the command with Ctrl-G.

After you type a file name, this version of the command simply displays
what you typed in the echo area.

Let's continue with the simple-insert-file command.
We will create an empty temporary buffer, read the file
into that buffer, transfer the characters to our buffer, then delete
the temporary buffer.  Also, let's get rid of the line that displays
what you just typed.  Make the file learn.e look like this:

Ω#include "eel.h"        /* standard definitions */≤≤command simple_insert_file()≤{≤        char inserted_file[FNAMELEN];≤        char *original_buffer = bufname;≤≤        get_file(inserted_file, "Insert file", "");≤        zap("tempbuf");      /* make an empty buffer */≤        bufname = "tempbuf"; /* use that buffer */≤        if (file_read(inserted_file, 1) != 0)≤                error("Read error: ≥s", inserted_file);≤                        /* copy the characters */≤        xfer(original_buffer, 0, size());≤                        /* move back to buffer */≤        bufname = original_buffer;≤        delete_buffer("tempbuf");≤}≤æ≤
This version has one more declaration at the beginning of the
command, namely

Ωchar *original_buffer = bufname;æ

This declares original_buffer to point to a character
array, and initializes it to point to the array named bufname.

The value of the variable bufname changes each time
the current buffer changes.  For this reason, we refer
to such variables as ªbuffer-specific variablesº.
At any given time, bufname contains the
name of the current buffer.  So this initialization
in effect stores the name of the current buffer in the local
variable original_buffer.

After the get_file( ) call, we create a new empty buffer
named "tempbuf" with the statement "zap("tempbuf");".  We then
make "tempbuf" the current buffer by setting the bufname variable
with the following.

Ωbufname = "tempbuf";æ

Now we can read the file in:

Ωif (file_read(inserted_file, 1) > 0)≤        error("Read error: ≥s", inserted_file);≤æ≤
This does several things.  First, it calls the file_read( ) primitive,
which reads a file into the current buffer.  It returns 0
if everything goes ok.  If the file doesn't exist,
or some other error occurs, it returns a nonzero
error code.  The actual return value in that case indicates the
specific problem.  This statement, then, executes the line

Ωerror("Read error: %s", inserted_file);æ

if an error occurred while reading the file.  Otherwise,
we move on to the next statement.  The primitive error( ) takes
the same arguments that say( ) takes.  It prints out the message
in the echo area, aborts the command, and drops any characters you
may have typed ahead.

Now we have the text of the file we want to insert in a buffer named
tempbuf.  The next statement,

Ωxfer(original_buffer, 0, size());æ

calls the primitive xfer( ), which transfers characters
from one buffer to another.  The first argument specifies the name of the
buffer to transfer characters to.  The second and third arguments
give the region of the current buffer to transfer.  In this
case, we want to transfer characters to original_buffer, which
holds the name of the buffer from which we invoked this command.
We want to transfer the whole thing, so we give it the parameters
0 and size( ).  The primitive size( ) returns the
number of characters in the current buffer.

The last two statements return us to our original buffer and delete the
temporary buffer.

Ω#include "eel.h"        /* standard definitions */≤≤char region_file[FNAMELEN];≤≤command simple_insert_file() on cx_tab['i']≤{≤    char inserted_file[FNAMELEN], *buf;≤    char *original_buffer = bufname;≤    int err;≤≤    iter = 0;≤    get_file(inserted_file, "Insert file", region_file);≤    mark = point;≤    bufname = buf = temp_buf();≤    err = file_read(inserted_file, 1);≤    if (!err)≤        xfer(original_buffer, 0, size());≤    bufname = original_buffer;≤    delete_buffer(buf);≤    if (err)≤        file_error(err, inserted_file, "read error");≤    else≤        strcpy(region_file, inserted_file);≤}≤æ≤
¿The final version of simple-insert-file¡

The final version of this command adds several more details.

On the first line, we've added on cx_tab['i'].
This tells Epsilon to
bind the command to Ctrl-X I.  We've added a new character
pointer variable named buf, because we will use Epsilon's
temp_buf( ) subroutine for our temporary buffer rather than the
wired-in name of "tempbuf".  This subroutine makes up an unused
buffer name and creates it for us.  It returns the name of the
buffer.

The line

Ωmark = point;æ

causes Epsilon to leave the region set
around the inserted text.  The xfer( ) will insert its text
between mark and point.  We've added the line iter = 0; to make
the command ignore any numeric argument.  Without this line, it would
ask you for a file to insert over and over, if you accidentally gave
it a numeric argument.

We now save the error code that file_read( ) returns so we can
delete the temporary buffer in the event of an error.  We also use the
file_error( ) primitive rather than error( ) because the former
will translate system error codes to text.

Finally, we added the line

Ωchar region_file[FNAMELEN];æ

to provide a default if you should execute the command
more than once.  Because this definition occurs outside of a function
definition, the variable persists even after the command finishes.
Variables defined within a function definition (local variables) go
away when the function finishes.  We copy the file name to
region_file each time you use the command, and pass it to
get_file( ) to provide a default value.

EEL compiler, type eel »filename….  If you
omit the file name, the compiler will display a message showing its
command line options.

Before the »filename…, you can optionally specify one or more
command line switches.  The EEL compiler looks for an environment
variable named EEL before examining its command line, then "types
in" the contents of that variable before the compiler's real command
line. Under Windows 95/98/NT, the EEL compiler uses a
registry entry named EEL (a "configuration variable", as described
in Rconfigvarsπconfigvars), not an environment variable.

The EEL compiler has the following flags:

 F-d, command line flag E#define, preprocessor commandŒ-d»mac…!»def… This flag defines the textual macro
»mac…, giving it the definition »def…, as if you had defined it
using the #define command.  The syntax -d»mac…
defines the macro »mac…, giving it the definition (1).  You can
also use the syntax -d»mac…=»def…, but beware: if you run
EEL via a .BAT or .CMD file, the system will replace any ='s with
spaces, and EEL will not correctly interpret the flag.

 F-e, command line flagŒ-e This flag tells the compiler to exclude definitions
from #included files when it writes the bytecode file.  This
results in smaller bytecode files.  You can safely use this flag when
compiling EEL files other than epsilon.e that only include the file
eel.h, but it's most useful with autoloaded files.  Epsilon will
signal an error if you call a function using a variable whose
definition has been omitted by -e in all loaded bytecode files.

Rincludepath F-i, command line flagŒ-i»directory…  This flag sets the
directories to search for files included with the preprocessor
#include command.  Precede each search directory with -i.  If
you use several -i flags on the command line, Epsilon will
search the directories in the order they appear.

¢EPSPATH, configuration variableIf you don't specify any search directories, EEL looks for an
EPSPATH configuration variable, which should
contain a list of directories, and searches in an "include"
subdirectory of each directory on the EPSPATH.  For example, if
EPSPATH is c:¥old;d:¥new, EEL searches in c:¥old¥include, then in d:¥new¥include.  Under
Windows 95/98/NT, the EEL compiler uses a registry entry named
EPSPATH (a "configuration variable", as described in Rconfigvarsπconfigvars), not an environment variable.  (In Epsilon for
Unix, a missing EPSPATH variable causes EEL to look in
/usr/local/epsilon»VER… (where »VER… is replaced by text
representing the current version, such as 101 for 10.1), then
/usr/local/epsilon and then /opt/epsilon.  In other versions, a
missing EPSPATH makes EEL skip this step.)

¢EEL also searches for included files based on the location of its
executable.  If the EEL executable is in c:¥somedir¥bin, EEL uses the default include path c:¥somedir¥include.  EEL's -w flag makes it skip this step.  EEL also skips
this step under Unix.

¢EEL always searches the current directory first if the file name in
the #include directive appears between quotes.  Then, if there are
any -i flags, EEL searches in the specified directories.  Next,
EEL searches based on the executable's location.  Finally, if there
were no -i flags, EEL searches based on the EPSPATH setting.

 F-n, command line flagŒ-n Makes the EEL compiler skip displaying its copyright
message.

 F-o, command line flagŒ-o»file… Sets the output file.  Normally EEL
constructs the file name for the bytecode file based on the input
file, with the .e extension replaced by ".b", and puts the bytecode
file in the current directory.

 F-p, command line flagŒ-p Makes the compiler display a preprocessed version of the
file.

 F-q, command line flagŒ-q Suppress warning messages about unused local
variables and function parameters.

 F-s, command line flagŒ-s Leave out debugging information from the bytecode file.
Such a file takes up less space, and runs a bit faster.  If you use
this switch, though, you cannot use the debugger on this file, and
the debug key Ctrl-⁄Scroll Lock€ (except under Windows and Unix)
will not work while such a function executes.  We compiled the
standard system with the -s flag.  You may wish to recompile
some files without this flag so you can trace through functions and
see how they work.

 F-v, command line flagŒ-v Prints a hash mark each time the compiler
encounters a function or global
variable definition.  Use it to follow the progress of the
compiler.

 F-w, command line flagŒ-w This flag tells EEL not to search for included files
based on the location of the EEL executable.  See the description of
the -i flag above.



An example using these switches is:

Ωeel -s -p -v -dCODE=3 -oout -i/headers source >preprocæ

2The EEL Preprocessor

 E#define, preprocessor commandEEL includes a preprocessor that can do macro substitution on the
source text, among other things.  You give preprocessor commands by
including lines that start with "#" in your source text.  A
backslash character "¥" at the end of a line makes the
preprocessor command continue to the next line.  This section lists
the available preprocessor commands.

Ωmacros, types of#define »identifier… »replacement-text…æ

This command defines a textual macro named »identifier….  When this
identifier appears again in normal text (not in quotes), it is
immediately replaced with the characters in the replacement text.

The rules for legal macro names are the same as the rules for
identifiers in the rest of EEL: a letter or the underscore character
"_", followed by any number of letters,
digits, or underscore characters.  Identifiers which differ by case
are different identifiers, so mabel, maBel, and MABEL could be three
different macros.  For clarity, it's best to use all upper case names
for macros, and avoid such names otherwise.

When the EEL compiler starts, the macro _EEL_ is predefined, with
replacement text (1).

Note that these textual EEL macros are not
related to keyboard macros.  Only the EEL compiler knows about
textual macros; Epsilon has no knowledge of them.  You cannot bind a
textual macro to a key, for example.  Keyboard macros can be bound to
a key, and the EEL compiler doesn't know anything about them, only
the main Epsilon program.  To further confuse matters, other editors
refer to their extension languages as macro languages, and call all
editor extensions "macros".  In this manual, we never use the word
"macro" to mean an editor extension written in EEL.

Ω#define »identifier…(»arg1…,»arg2…,»arg3…,...) »replacement-text…æ

A macro with arguments is like a normal macro, but instances of the
identifier in normal text must be followed by the same number of text
sections (separated by commas) as there are arguments.  Commas inside
quotes or parentheses don't separate text sections.  Each of these
text sections replace the corresponding identifier within the
replacement text.  For example, the preprocessor changes

Ω#define COLOR(fg, bg)   ((fg) + ((bg) << 4))≤int modecol=COLOR(8, 3);≤int mcol=COLOR(new_col(6,2),name_to_col("green"));≤æ≤
to

Ωint modecol=((8) + ((3) << 4))≤int mcol=((new_col(6,2))+((name_to_col("green"))<<4))≤æ≤
The command

Ω E#undef, preprocessor command#undef »identifier…æ

removes the effect of a prior #define for the rest of
a compilation.

The command

Ω E#include, preprocessor command#include <»filename…>æ

inserts the text in another file at this point in the
source text.  #include's may be nested.  In the above format,
the EEL compiler searches for the file in each of the #include
directories specified on the command line, or in a default location
if none were specified.  See Rincludepathπincludepath.

If you use quote marks (" ") instead of angle brackets
(< >) around the file name of the #include command, the EEL compiler
will first look in the current directory for the file, before searching
the #include directories as above.  With either delimiter, the compiler
will ignore attempts to include a single file more than once in a
compilation.

The EEL compiler keeps track of the current source file name and line
number to provide error messages during compilation, and passes this
information along in the bytecode file (unless you used the -s
command line option to suppress this).  Epsilon then uses this
information for the EEL debugger and profiler, and displays it when
certain errors occur.  You can change the compiler's notion of the
current line and source file with the command

Ω E#line, preprocessor command E#endif, preprocessor command E#if, preprocessor command#line »number… "»filename…"æ

This makes the compiler believe the current file is »filename…, and
the #line command appears on line »number… of it.  If the file
name is omitted, only the line number is changed.

#if »constant-expression…Ω
æ... text ...Ω
æ#endif

The #if command permits sections of the source text to be
conditionally included.  A constant expression (defined in Rconstexpπconstexp) follows the #if.  If the value of the
constant expression is nonzero, text from this point to a matching
#endif command is included.  Otherwise, that region is ignored.

#if »constant-expression…Ω
æ... text ...Ω
æ#elseΩ
æ... text ...Ω
æ#endif

 E#else, preprocessor commandIf an #else command appears between the #if and the
#endif, the text following the #else is ignored whenever the
text preceding it is not.  In other words, the text following the
#else is ignored if the constant is nonzero.

 E#ifdef, preprocessor command E#ifndef, preprocessor command#ifdef »identifier…Ω
æ... text ...Ω
æ#endifΩ
æΩ
æ#ifndef »identifier…Ω
æ... text ...Ω
æ#endif

You can use the #ifdef command in place of the #if command.
It ignores text between the command and a matching #endif if the
identifier is not currently defined as a textual macro with the
#define command.  The text is included if the macro is defined.
The #ifndef command is the same, but with the condition
reversed.  It includes the text only if the macro is undefined.  Both
commands may have an #else section, as with #if.

2Lexical Rules

comments in EELComments in EEL begin with the characters
/*, outside of any quotes.  They end with the characters */.
The sequence /* has no effect while inside a comment, nor do
preprocessor control lines.

You can also begin a comment with the characters //, outside of
quotes.  This kind of comment continues until the end of the line.

3Identifiers

reserved EEL keywordsidentifiersªIdentifiersº in EEL consist of a letter or the underscore
character "_", followed by any number of letters, digits, or
underscore characters.  Upper case and lower case characters are
distinct to the compiler, so Ab and ab are different
identifiers.  When you load an identifier into Epsilon, Epsilon
converts underscores "_" to hyphens "-" and converts
identifiers to lower case.  For example, when invoking a command that
has been defined in an EEL source file as this_command(), you type
this-command.  All characters are significant, and no
identifier (or any token, for that matter) may be longer than 1999
characters.

The following identifiers are keywords, and you cannot use them for any other
purpose:

Ωif              switch          struct          static≤else            case            union           unsigned≤for             default         keytable        enum≤do              goto            typedef         color_class≤while           sizeof          buffer          save_spot≤return          char            window          save_var≤break           short           command         spot≤continue        int             on              on_exit≤user            volatile        zeroed          color_scheme≤æ≤
The keywords on_exit, enum, unsigned, and static have
no function in the current version of EEL, but we reserve them for
future use.

3Numeric Constants

binary constantshex
constantsoctal
constantdecimal constantnumeric constantconstantsThe term ªnumeric constantº collectively
refers to decimal constants, octal constants, binary constants and
hex constants.

A sequence of digits is a ªdecimal constantº, unless it begins
with the digit 0.  If it begins with a 0, it is an ªoctal
constantº (base 8).  The characters 0x followed by a hexadecimal
number are also recognized (the digits 0-9 and the letters a-f or
the letters A-F form hexadecimal numbers).  These are the ªhex
constantsº.  The characters 0b followed by a binary number form a
ªbinary constantº.  A binary number
contains only the digits 0 and 1.

All numeric constants in EEL are of type int.

3Character Constants

character
constantRescsequencesText enclosed in single quotes as in 'a' is a ªcharacter
constantº.  The type of a character constant is int.  Its value is
the ASCII code for the character.  Instead of a single character, an
escape sequence can appear between the quotes.  Each escape sequence
begins with a backslash, followed by either an octal or hexadecimal
number (representing the character with that ASCII code) or a letter
in the following table.  A backslash followed by any other character
represents that character.

The special escape sequences are:

Ω– 2 10 ¥nnewline character, ^J¥bbackspace character, ^H¥ttab character, ^I¥rreturn character, ^M¥fform feed character, ^L¥»yyy…character with ASCII code »yyy… octal¥x»hh…character with ASCII code »hh… hexadecimal—æ

For example, '¥'' represents the ' character,
'¥¥' represents the ¥ character,
'¥0' represents the null character, and
'¥n', '¥12', and  '¥x0A',
all represent the newline character (whose ASCII code is 12 in octal
notation, base 8, and 0A in hexadecimal, base 16).

Anywhere a numeric constant is permitted, so is a character constant,
and vice versa.

3String Constants

string constantText enclosed in double quote characters (such as "example") is
a ªstring constantº.  It produces a block of storage whose type is
ªarray of charº, and whose value is the sequence of characters
between the double quotes, with a null character (ASCII code 0)
automatically added at the end.  All the escape sequences for
character constants work here too.

The compiler merges a series of adjacent string constants into a
single string constant (before automatically adding a null character
at the end).  For example, "sample" "text" produces the
same single block of storage as "sampletext".

2Scope of Variables

local variableglobal variablelifetime
of variablesscope of variablesvariables, in EELVariables may have two different kinds of "lifetimes",
or ªscopesº.  If you declare a variable outside of any function
declaration, it is a ªglobal variableº.  If you declare it inside
a function declaration, it is a ªlocal variableº.

A local variable only exists while the function it is local to (the
one you declared it in) is executing.  It vanishes when the
function returns, and reappears (with some different value) when the
function executes later.  If you call the function recursively,
each call of the function has its own value for the local variable.
You may also declare a variable to be local to a block, in which case it
exists only while code inside the block is executing.  A
local variable so declared only has meaning inside the function or block it
is local to.

A global variable exists independently of any function.  Any function may
use it.  If functions declared in different source
files use the same global variable, the variable must be declared in
both source files (or in files #included by both files)
before its first use.  If the two files have different
initializations for the variable, only the first initialization has
effect.

If a local variable has the same name as a global variable, the local
masks the global variable.  All references in the block to a
variable of that name, from the local variable's definition until the
end of the block it is defined in, are to the local variable.  After
the end of the block, the name again refers to the global variable.

buffer-specific variables
variables, buffer-specificRdotdefbuffer, keyworddefault valueYou can declare any global variable to be ªbuffer-specificº using
the buffer keyword.
A buffer-specific variable has a value for each buffer and a default
value.  The default value is the value the variable has when you
create a new buffer (and hence a new occurrence of the
buffer-specific variable).  When you refer to a buffer-specific
variable, you normally refer to the part that changes from buffer to
buffer.  To refer to the default portion, append ".default" to the
variable name.  For example, suppose the variable
foo is buffer-specific.  References to foo would then refer
to the value associated with the current buffer.  To refer to the
default value, you would use the expression
foo.default. (The syntax of appending
".default" is available only when writing EEL programs, not when
specifying a variable name to set-variable, for example.)
When you save Epsilon's state using the write-state command,
Epsilon saves only the default value of each buffer variable, not the
value for the current buffer.

variables, window-specificwindow-specific
variables Ewindow, EEL keywordGlobal variables may also be
declared ªwindow-specificº using the window keyword.  A window-specific variable has a
separate value for each window and a default value.  When Epsilon
starts from a state file, it uses the default value saved in the
state file to set up the first window.  When you split a window, the
new window's variables start off with the same values as the original
window.  Epsilon also uses the default value to initialize each new
pop-up window.  You can append ".default" to refer to the default
value of a window-specific variable.

2Data Types

 Espot, EEL keyword Echar, EEL keyword Eshort, EEL keyword Eint, EEL keywordbasic typesspotcharshortintEEL supports a rich set of data types.  First there are the
ªbasic typesº:
Œint These are 32 bit signed quantities.  These correspond to
integers.  The value of an int ranges from  -2,147,483,648 to
2,147,483,647.

Œshort These are like ints, except they are only 16 bits.  Thus
the value ranges from -32768 to 32767.

Œchar These are 8 bit unsigned quantities.  They
correspond to characters.  For example, the buffer primitive
curchar( ) returns an object of type char.  The values range from
0 to 255.

Œspot These are references to buffer positions.  A
spot can remember a buffer position in such a way that after
inserting or deleting characters in the buffer, the spot will still
be between the same two characters.  Like pointers, spots can also
hold the special value zero.  See Rspotπspot.



Besides basic types, there is an infinite set of types derived
from these.  They are defined recursively as follows:
Œpointer If »t… is some type, then
»pointer to t… is also a type.  Conceptually, this is the address
of some object of type t.  When you dereference an object of type
»pointer to t…, the result is of type »t….

Œarray If »t… is some type, then »array of t… is also a type.

Œstructure If ªt1º, ... , ªtnº are types, then
»structure of… ªt1º, ... , ªtnº is also a type.
Conceptually, a structure is a sequence of objects, where the »j…th
object is of type ªtjº.

Œunion If ªt1º, ... , ªtnº are types, then
»union of… ªt1º, ... , ªtnº is also a type.
Conceptually, a union is an object that can be of any of type
ªt1º, ... , ªtnº at different times.

Œfunction If »t… is a type, then »function returning t… is
also a type.


Any function has a type, which is the type of the value it returns.
If the function returns no value, it is of int type, but it is
illegal to attempt to use the function's value.

commandcommand, definedsubroutinecommand, eel keyword Ecommand, EEL keywordRegardless of its type,
you may declare any function to be a command (using the
command keyword) if it takes no
parameters.  Commands like named-command on Alt-X will then
complete on its name, but there is no other difference between
commands and ªsubroutinesº (user-defined functions which are not
commands).  Functions that the user is expected to invoke directly
(by pressing a key, for example) are generally commands, while
functions that act as helpers to commands are generally subroutines.
Nothing prevents an EEL function from calling a command directly,
though, and the user can invoke any subroutine directly as well
(providing that it takes no arguments).  Though a command may not
have arguments, it may return a value (which is ignored when the user
directly invokes it).

3Declarations

type specifierdeclarationRdeclarationsDeclarations in EEL associate a type with an identifier.  The structure
of EEL declarations mimics the recursive nature of EEL types.

A ªdeclarationº is of the form:

Ωªdeclaration:≤        type-specifier ;≤        type-specifier declarator-list ;≤≤declarator-list:≤        declarator≤        declarator , declarator-list≤ºæ≤
A ªtype specifierº names one of the basic types, a structure or
union (described in Rstructdeclπstructdecl), or a typedef, a type
abbreviation (described in Rtypedefπtypedef).

Ωªdeclaratortype-specifier:≤        char≤        short≤        int≤        struct struct-or-union-specifier≤        union struct-or-union-specifier≤        spot≤        typedef-name≤≤typedef-name:≤        identifier≤ºæ≤
A ªdeclaratorº, on the other hand, specifies the relationship of
the identifier being declared to the type named by the type specifier.
If this is a recursive type, the relationship of the identifier's type
to the basic type of the type specifier is indicated by the form of
the declarator.

Declarators are of the following form:

Ωª≤declarator:≤        identifier≤        ( declarator )≤        * declarator≤        declarator [ constant-expression ]≤        declarator [ ]≤        declarator ()≤ºæ≤
If »D… is a declarator, then (»D…) is identical to »D….
Use parentheses to alter the binding of composed declarators.
We discuss this more in Rcompositedeclsπcompositedecls.

3Simple Declarators

In the simplest case, the identifier being declared is of one of the
basic types.  For that, the declarator is simply the identifier
being declared.  For example, the declarations

Ωint length;≤char this_character;≤short small_value;≤æ≤
declare the type of the identifier length to be int,
the type of this_character to be char, and the type of
small_value to be short.

If the relationship between the identifier and the type specified in
the type specifier is more complex, so is the declarator.  Each type
of declarator in the following sections contains exactly one
identifier, and that is the identifier being declared.

3Pointer Declarators

Pointer declarators are used in conjunction with type specifiers to
declare variables of type »pointer to t…, where »t… is some type.
The form of a pointer declarator is

Ωª* declarator≤ºæ≤
Suppose »T… is a type specifier and »D… is a declarator, and the
declaration "»T D…;" declares the identifier embedded in »D…
to be of type "... »T…".  Then the declaration »T *D;… declares
the identifier in »D… to be of type "... »pointer to T…".
Several examples illustrate the concept.

Ωint l;≤int *lptr;≤int **ldblptr;≤æ≤
Clearly, the first declaration declares l to be of type int.  The
type specifier is int and the declarator is l.

The second line is a little more complicated.  The type specifier is
still int, but the declarator is *lptr.  Using the
rule above, we see that lptr is a pointer to an int.  This
is immediately clear from the above if you substitute "int" for »T…,
and "lptr" for »D….

Similarly, the third line declares ldblptr to be a pointer to a pointer
to an int.

3Array Declarators

Array declarators are used in conjunction with type specifiers to
declare objects of type »array of t…, where »t… is some type.  The
form of an array declarator is

Ωªdeclarator [ constant-expression ]≤ºæ≤
but you may omit the constant expression if

 An ªinitializedº global variable of type
"»array of… ..." is being defined.  (See Rinitializationπinitialization.)  In this case, the first
constant-expression may be omitted, and the size of the array will be
calculated from the initializer.

 A ªfunction argumentº (sometimes called a formal parameter)
of type "»array of… ..." is being declared.  Since the type of
the argument will be changed to "»pointer to… ..." (as
described in Rargtypeπargtype) the first constant-expression
may be omitted.



The rules for constant expressions appear in Rconstexpπconstexp.

Suppose »T… is a type specifier and »D… is a declarator, and the
declaration "»T D;…" declares the identifier embedded in »D… to be of
type "... »T…".  Then the declaration »T (D)[ ];… declares the
identifier to be of type "... »array of T…".

As an example, consider:

Ωint (one_dim)[35];≤int ((two_dim)[35])[44];≤æ≤
The first line declares the identifier one_dim to be of type
ªarray of intº.

The second line declares two_dim to be ªarray of array of
intº.  Clearly, we can have arbitrary multi-dimensional arrays by
declaring the arrays in this manner.

As another example, consider the following:

Ωchar (*arg);≤char (*argptr)[5];≤char *(argary[5]);≤æ≤
From the preceding section, we know that the first line declares
arg to be a pointer to a char.  From this section, we see that
the second line declares argptr to be of type ªpointer to
array of charº.

Compare this to the third line, which declares argary to be of
type ªarray of pointer to charº.

When you have mixed declarators as you have in this example, you
sometimes can elide parentheses according to the precedence rules of
declarators.  See Rcompositedeclsπcompositedecls for these precedences.

3Function Declarators

Function declarators are used in conjunction with type specifiers to
declare variables of type ªfunction returning tº, where ªtº is
some type.  The form of a function declarator is

Ωªdeclarator ()≤ºæ≤
or

Ωªdeclarator ( ansi-argument-list )≤ºæ≤
Again, suppose »T… is a type specifier and »D… is a declarator,
and the declaration "»T D;…" declares the identifier embedded in
»D… to be of type "... »T…".  Then the declaration
»T… (»D…)(); declares the identifier to be of type
"... »function returning T…".

Consider:

ΩRfuncdeclchar (c)();≤char *(fpc());≤char (*pfc)(int count, char *msg);≤æ≤
The first line declares c to be of type
ªfunction returning charº.  The second line declares fpc to be
a ªfunction returning pointer to charº.  The third line declares
pfc to be of type ªpointer to function returning charº.  The
third example also declares that pfc requires two parameters and
gives their types; the first two examples provide no information
about their functions' parameters.

3Structures and Unions

structure-or-union
specifierRstructdeclThis section describes how to define variables of
type ªstructure ofº ªt1º, ..., ªtnº, where ªt1º,
..., ªtnº are each types.  First, we give an informal
description, with examples, of how structures are often declared.  A
more formal description with BNF diagrams follows.

There is a special type-specifier, called a ªstructure-or-union
specifierº, that defines structure and union types.  This
type-specifier has several forms.

The simplest form is seen in the following example:

Ωfield namesstruct {≤    int field1;≤    char name[30];≤    char *data;≤}≤æ≤
The field names of the structure are the identifiers being declared
within the curly braces.  These declarations look like variable
declarations, but instead of declaring variables, they declare
ªfield namesº.  The type of a particular field is the type the
identifier would have if the declaration were a variable declaration.

The example above refers to a structure with fields named field1,
name, and data, with types ªintº, ªarray of charº, and
ªpointer to charº, respectively.

Use the structure-or-union specifier like the other type-specifiers
(int, short, char, and spot) in declarations.  For example:

Ωtag, struct or unionstruct {≤    int field1;≤    char name[30];≤    char *data;≤} rec, *recptr, recary[4];≤æ≤
declares rec to be a structure variable, recptr to be a
pointer to a structure, and recary to be an array of (4)
structures.

The structure-or-union-specifier
may contain a ªtagº, which gives
a short name for the entire structure.  For example, the
type-specifier in the following example:

Ωstruct recstruct {≤    int field1;≤    char name[30];≤    char *data;≤};≤æ≤
creates a new type, struct recstruct, that refers to the structure
being defined.  Given this structure tag, we may define our structure
variables in the following manner:

Ωstruct recstruct rec, *recptr, recary[4];≤æ≤
Structure (or union) tags also let you create self-referential types.
Consider the following:

Ωstruct list {≤    int data;≤    struct list *next;≤};≤≤struct list list1, list2;≤æ≤
This creates a structure type list, which has a data field
that's an int, and a next field that is a pointer to a list
structure.  A structure may not contain an instance of itself, but may
contain (as in this example) a pointer to an object of its type.

More formally, a structure-or-union-specifier has the following form:

Ωªstruct-or-union-specifier:≤        struct-or-union-tag≤        struct-or-union-tag µ member-list ∂≤        µ member-list ∂≤≤struct-or-union-tag:≤        identifier≤≤member-list:≤        type-specifier declarator-list ;≤        type-specifier declarator-list ; member-list≤ºæ≤
A description of how to use structures and unions in expressions
appears in Rstructexpπstructexp.

3Complex Declarators

RcompositedeclsAs some of the examples thus far have shown, you can compose
(combine) declarators to yield arbitrarily complicated types, like
ªfunction returning pointer to an array of 10 charsº:

Ωchar (*foo())[10]æ;

When composing declarators, function and array declarators have
the same precedence.  They each take precedence over pointer
declarators.  So the example we used in Rfuncdeclπfuncdecl:

Ωchar *(fpc());æ

could have been written more simply as

Ωchar *fpc();æ.

The rule that EEL follows for declarations is that the identifier
involved is to be declared so that an expression with the form of the
declarator has the type of the type specifier.  This implies that the
grouping of operators in a declarator follows the same rules as the
operators do in an expression.

There are a few restrictions on the combinations of declarators when
functions are involved (and so on the combinations of types).
Functions may not return arrays, structures, unions, or functions, but
they may return pointers to any of these.  Similarly, functions may
not be members of structures, unions, or arrays, but pointers to
functions may be.

3Typedefs

RtypedefΩªtypedef-definition:≤        typedef type-specifier declarator-list ;≤ºæ≤
You can use typedefs to provide convenient names for complicated
types.  Once you define it, use a typedef as a type specifier (like
int) in any declaration.  A typedef definition looks just like a
variable definition, except that the keyword typedef appears
before the type specifier.  The name of the typedef being defined
appears instead of the variable name, and the typedef has the same
type the variable would have had.

Typedefs only serve as abbreviations.  They always create types that
could be made in some other way.  A variable declared using a typedef
is just the same as a variable declared using the full specification.
For example:

Ωtypedef short *NAME_LIST;≤NAME_LIST nl, narray[20];≤æ≤
is equivalent to

Ωshort *nl, *narray[20];≤æ≤
3Type Names

type namesRtypenameEEL's sizeof operator and its casting operator specify particular
types using ªtype namesº.  A type name looks like a declaration of a
single variable, except that the variable name is missing (as is the
semicolon at the end).  For example, int * is a type name
referring to a pointer to an int.

Ωªtype-name:≤        type-specifier abstract-declarator≤≤abstract-declarator:≤        empty≤        ( abstract-declarator )≤        * abstract-declarator≤        abstract-declarator [ constant-expression ]≤        abstract-declarator [ ]≤        abstract-declarator ( )≤        abstract-declarator ( ansi-argument-list )≤ºæ≤
Note that you could interpret a type name like int *() in two
ways: either as a function returning a pointer to an int (like
int *foo();) or as a pointer to an int (like int
*(foo);).  EEL rules out the latter by requiring that a
parenthesized ªabstract-declaratorº be nonempty.  Given this, the
system is not ambiguous, and an identifier can appear in only one
place in each type name to make a legal declaration.

The same precedence rules apply to type names as to normal
declarators (or to expressions).  For example, the type name
char *[10] refers to an array of 10 pointers to characters, but
char (*)[10] refers to a pointer to an array of 10 characters.

2Initialization

RinitializationDeclarations for the formal parameters of functions work just as
described above, but you can additionally provide local and global variables
with a specific initial value.

Ωªinitialization, of variableslocal-variable-definition:≤        type-specifier local-declarator-list ;≤≤local-declarator-list:≤        local-declarator≤        local-declarator , local-declarator-list≤≤local-declarator:≤        declarator≤        declarator = expression≤ºæ≤
You can initialize a local variable with any expression so long as
the  corresponding assignment
would be permitted.  Since you cannot assign to variables with types
such as "ªarray ofº ..." and "ªstructure ofº ...", you
cannot initialize such local variables at compile time.  Local
variables (those defined within a block) have undefined initial
values if no explicit initialization is present.

Ωªglobal-variable-definition:≤        type-specifier global-declarator-list ;≤        global-modifier-list global-declarator-list ;≤        global-modifier-list type-specifier global-declarator-list ;≤≤global-modifier-list:≤        global-modifier≤        global-modifier global-modifier-list≤≤global-modifier:≤        buffer≤        window≤        zeroed≤        user≤        volatile≤≤global-declarator-list:≤        global-declarator≤        global-declarator , global-declarator-list≤≤global-declarator:≤        declarator≤        declarator = string-constant≤        declarator = initializer≤≤initializer:≤        constant-expression≤        µ initializer-list ∂≤        µ initializer-list , ∂≤≤initializer-list:≤        initializer≤        initializer , initializer-list≤ºæ≤
You may initialize
a global variable of type "array of characters" with a string
constant.  If you omit the length of the array in a declaration with
such an initialization, it's set to just contain the initializing string
(including its terminating null character).

initialization, of variablesIf no explicit initialization is specified, variables defined
globally are set to zero.  If you provide a partial initialization
(for example, if you specify the first 5 characters in a 10 character
array), the remainder of the variable is set to zero.  Initializers
for global variables must involve only constant
 expressions known at compile
time, whereas initializers for local variables may involve arbitrary
expressions (including function calls, for example).

When Epsilon loads a file defining an initialized global variable and
the variable was already defined to have the same type, the
initialization has no effect: the variable's value remains the same.
If the new declaration specifies a different type for the variable,
however, the variable's value is indeed changed.  (Actually, Epsilon
only compares the sizes of the variables.  If you redefine an integer
as a four character array, Epsilon won't apply the new initialization.)
For example, suppose you declare foo to be an int and initialize it
to 5.  If you later load a file which redeclares foo to be an int
and initializes it to 7, the value of foo would remain 5.  If
instead you redeclare foo to be a char and reinitialize it to 'C',
then the value would change, since the size of a char is different from
the size of an int.

Rvolatilevolatile Evolatile, EEL keywordTo tell Epsilon that it must reinitialize the
variable each time it reads a definition, use the volatile
keyword.  Every time you load a bytecode file containing such a
variable definition, Epsilon will set the variable according to its
initialization.

If you declare a global variable that is a number, spot, or pointer,
the initializer must be a constant expression.  In fact, if the
variable is a spot or pointer, you can only initialize it with the
constant zero.  For example:

Ωint i=3;≤char *name="harold";≤æ≤
initializes the int variable i to be 3, and the
character pointer name to point to the first character in the
string "harold".  The variable name must be a local
variable.  If it were global, then you could initialize it only to
zero, which is equivalent to not initializing it at all (see above).

If you declare a global array, you can initialize each element
of the array.  The initializer in this case would be a
sequence of constant expressions, separated by commas, with the whole
thing enclosed in braces µ∂.  Consider the following examples:

Ωint ary1[4] = { 10, 20, 30, 40 };≤int ary2[ ] = { 10, 20, 30, 40 };≤int ary3[4] = { 10, 20 };≤æ≤
Here we have ary1 declared to be an array of 4 ints.  We
initialize the first element in the array to 10, the second to 20,
and so on.  The declaration of ary2 does the same thing.  Notice
that the square brackets in the declarator are empty.  The EEL
compiler can tell from the initializer that the size must be 4.  The
declaration of ary3 specifies the size of the array, but only
initializes the first two elements.  The compiler initializes the
remaining two elements to zero.

The initializers for global structures are similar.  The items
between the curly braces are a sequence of expressions, with each
expression's type matching the type of the corresponding field name.
For example, the declaration:

Ωstruct {≤    int f1;≤    char f2;≤    short f3;≤} var = { 33, 't', 22 };≤æ≤
declares the variable var to be a structure with fields f1,
f2, and f3, with types ªintº, ªcharº, and ªshortº
respectively.  The declaration initializes the f1 to 33, the character
field f2 to 't', and the short field f3
to 22.

You cannot initialize either unions or local structures.  Global pointers
may only be initialized to zero (which is equivalent to not
initializing them at all).

If you initialize
an array or structure which has subarrays or
substructures, simply recursively apply the
rules for initialization.  For example, consider the following:

Ωstruct {≤    char c;≤    int ary1[3];≤} var = { 't',  { 3, 4, 5} };≤æ≤
This declares var to be a structure containing a character and an
array of 3 ints.  It initializes the character to 't', and the
array of ints so that the first element is 3, the
second 4, and the third 5.

2Statements

EEL has all of the statements of the C programming language.  You can
precede a statement by a ªlabelº, an identifier followed by a
colon, which you can use with the goto statement to explicitly
alter the flow of control.  Except where noted below, statements are
executed in order.

3Expression Statement

Ωªexpression;≤ºæ≤
The expression is simply evaluated.  This is the form of function
calls and assignments, and is the most common type of statement in
EEL.

3If Statement

 Eif, EEL keywordifΩªif ( expression )≤        statement≤ºæ≤
If the value of ªexpressionº is not zero,
ªstatementº executes.  Otherwise control passes to the statement
after the if statement.

Ωªif ( expression )≤        statement1≤else≤        statement2≤ºæ≤
If the value of ªexpressionº is not zero, ªstatement1º executes.
If the value of ªexpressionº is zero, control passes to ªstatement2º.

3Looping Statements

 Ewhile, EEL keywordwhileΩªwhile ( expression )≤        statement≤ºæ≤
In a while loop, the ªexpressionº is evaluated.  If
nonzero, the ªstatementº executes, and the expression is evaluated
again.  This happens over and over until the expression's value is
zero.  If the expression is zero the first time it is evaluated,
ªstatementº is not executed at all.

Ωªdo Edo, EEL keyworddo≤        statement≤while ( expression);≤ºæ≤
A do while loop is just like a plain while
loop, except the statement executes ªbeforeº the expression is
evaluated.  Thus, the statement will always be evaluated at least
once.

Ωªfor Efor, EEL keywordfor ( expression1; expression2; expression3 )≤        statement≤ºæ≤
In a for loop, first ªexpression1º is evaluated.  Then
ªexpression2º is evaluated, and if it is zero EEL leaves the loop
and begins executing instructions after ªstatementº.  Otherwise the
statement is executed, ªexpression3º is evaluated, and
ªexpression2º is evaluated again, continuing until ªexpression2º
is zero.

You can omit any of the expressions.  If you omit ªexpression2º, it
is like ªexpression2º is nonzero.  while (ªexpressionº) is
the same as for (; ªexpressionº; ).  The syntax for (;;)
creates an endless loop that must be exited using the break
statement (or one of the other statements described below).

3Switch Statements

 Ecase, EEL keyword Eswitch, EEL keywordcaseswitchΩªswitch ( expression )≤        statement≤ºæ≤
≤Ωªcase constant-expression: statement≤ºæ≤
≤Ωªdefault Edefault, EEL keyworddefault: statement≤ºæ≤
Statements within the ªstatementº following the switch
(which is usually a block, as described below) are labeled with
constant expressions using case.  The ªexpressionº is
evaluated (it must yield an int), and Epsilon branches to the
case statement with the matching constant.  If there is no match,
Epsilon branches to the default statement if there is one,
and skips over the switch statement if not.

A case or default statement associates with the smallest
surrounding switch statement.  Each switch statement must
have at most one case statement with any given value, and at most
one default statement.

3Break and Continue Statements

 Econtinue, EEL keyword Ebreak, EEL keywordcontinuebreakΩªbreak;≤ºæ≤
This statement exits from the smallest containing for, while,
do while or switch statement.  The break statement
must be the last statement in each case if you don't want
execution to "fall through" and execute the statements for the
following cases too.

Ωªcontinue;≤ºæ≤
The continue statement immediately performs the test for
the smallest enclosing for, while, or do while statement.
It is the same as jumping to the end of the ªstatementº in each of
their definitions.  In the case of for, ªexpression3º will be
evaluated first.

3Return Statement

 Ereturn, EEL keywordreturnΩªreturn;≤ºæ≤
≤Ωªreturn expression;≤ºæ≤
The return statement exits from the function it appears in.
The first form returns no value, and produces an error message if you
called the function in a way that requires a value.  The second form
returns ªexpressionº as the value of the function.  It must have
the same type as you declared the function to be.  It is not an error
for the value to be unused by the caller.

If execution reaches the end of a function definition, it is the same
as if return; were there.

3Save_var Statements

ΩªRsave-varsave_var Esave_var, EEL keywordstatement:≤        save_var save-list;≤        save_spot save-list;≤≤save-list:≤        save-item≤        save-item , save-list≤≤save-item:≤        identifier≤        identifier = expression≤        identifier modify-operator expression≤        identifier ++≤        identifier ø≤ºæ≤
The save_var statement tells Epsilon to
remember the current value of a variable, and set it back to its
current value when the function that did the save_var exits.
Epsilon will restore the value no matter how the function exits, even
if it calls another function which signals an error, and this aborts
out of the calling function.

You can provide a new value for the variable at the same time you
save the old one.  Epsilon first saves the old value, then assigns
the new one.  You can use any of the assignment operators listed in Rmodopsπmodops, as well as the ++ and ø operators.

For example, this command plays a note at 440 Hz for one second,
without permanently changing the user's variable settings for the
bell.

Ωsave_spot Esave_spot, EEL keywordcommand play_note()≤{≤    save_var beep_frequency = 440;≤    save_var beep_duration = 100;≤    ding();      /* uses beep_ variables */≤}≤æ≤
The save_spot statement functions like save_var, but it
creates a ªspotº (see Rspotπspot) in the current buffer to
hold the old value.  The spot will automatically go away when the
function exits.  Use save_spot instead of save_var when
you wish to save a buffer position, and you want it to stay in the
right place even if the buffer contents change.

The save_var and save_spot statements can apply
to global variables with "simple" types: those that you can directly
assign to with the = operator.  They don't work on structures,
for example, or on local variables.

Although the save_var and save_spot statements resemble
variable declarations, they are true statements.  You can use the
if statement (above), for example, to only save a variable in
certain cases.  These statements operate with a "stack" of saved
values, so that if you save the same variable twice in a function,
only the first setting will have an effect on the final value of the
variable.  (Repeated save statements take up space on the saved value
stack, however, so they should be avoided.)  When you save a
buffer-specific or window-specific variable, Epsilon remembers which
buffer's or window's value was saved, and restores only that one.

restore_vars() Prestore_vars(), primitiveThe restore_vars( ) primitive restores all variables saved in
the current function.  After a restore_vars( ), future
modifications to any saved variables won't be undone.

3Goto and Empty Statements

 Egoto, EEL keywordgotoΩªgoto label;≤ºæ≤
≤Ωªlabel: statement≤ºæ≤
The next statement executed after the goto will be the one
following the ªlabelº.  It must appear in the same function as the
goto, but may be before or after.

Ωª;≤ºæ≤
This null statement is occasionally used in looping statements, where
all the "work" of the loop is done by the expressions.  For
example, a loop that calls a function foo() repeatedly until it
returns zero can be written as

Ωwhile (foo()) ;æ.

3Block

blockRblocksΩªµ≤declarations≤statements≤∂≤ºæ≤
Anywhere you can have a statement, you can have a ªblockº.  A
block contains any number of ªdeclarationsº, followed
by any number of ªstatementsº (including zero).  The variables
declared in the block are local to the block, and you may only use
them in the ªstatementsº (or in statements contained in those
statements).  The body of a function definition is itself a block.

2Conversions

conversion of variablesRconversionsWhen a value of a certain type is changed to
another type, a ªconversionº occurs.

When a number of some type is converted to another type of number, if
the number can be represented in the latter type its value will be
unchanged.  All possible characters can be represented as ints or
short ints, and all short ints can be represented as ints, so these
conversions yield unchanged values.

Technically, Epsilon will sign-extend a short int to convert it
to an int, but will pad a character with zero bits on the left to
convert it to an int or short int.  Converting a number of
some type to a number of a shorter type is always done by dropping
bits.

A pointer may not be converted to an int, or vice versa, except
for function pointers.  The latter may be converted to a short int, or
to any type that a short int may be converted to.  A pointer to one
type may be converted to a pointer to another type, as long as
neither of them is a function pointer.

All operators that take numbers as operands will take any size
numbers (characters, short ints, or ints).  The operands will
be converted to int if they aren't already ints.  Operators that
yield numbers always produce ints.

¿Operator Precedence¡

RopprecIn an expression like

 10 »op1… 20 »op2… 30

the compiler determines the rules for grouping by the
ªprecedenceº and ªassociativityº of the operators »op1… and
»op2….  Each operator in EEL has a certain precedence, with some
precedences higher than others.  If »op1… and »op2… have different
precedences, the one with the higher precedence groups tighter.  In
the table above, operators with higher precedences appear on a line
above operators with lower precedences.  Operators with the same
precedence appear on the same line.

For example, say »op1… is + and »op2… is *.  Since
*'s line appears above +'s, * has a higher precedence
than + and the expression 10 + 20 * 30 is the same as
10 +(20 * 30).

If two operators have the same precedence, the compiler determines
the grouping by their associativity, which is either left-to-right or
right-to-left.  All operators of the same precedence have the same
associativity.  For example, suppose »op1… is - and »op2… is
+.  These operators have the same precedence, and associate
left-to-right.  Thus 10 - 20 + 30 is the same (10 - 20) + 30.
All operators on the same line in the table have the same precedence,
and their associativity is given with either "l-to-r" or
"r-to-l."

Enclosing an expression in parentheses alters the grouping of
operators.  It does not change the value or type of an expression
itself.

2Order of Evaluation

Most operators do not guarantee a particular order of evaluation for
their operands.  If an operator does, we mention that fact in its
description below.  In the absence of such a guarantee, the compiler
may rearrange calculations within a single expression as it wishes,
if the result would be unchanged ignoring any possible side effects.

For example, if an expression assigns a value to a variable and uses
the variable in the same expression, the result is undefined unless
an operator that guarantees order of evaluation occurs at an
appropriate point.

Note that parentheses do not alter the order of evaluation, but only
serve to change the grouping of operators.  Thus in the statement

Ωi = foo() + (bar() + baz());æ

the three functions may be called in any order.

2Expressions
3Constants and Identifiers

RarraytoptrΩªRlvalueslvalue expressionsexpression:≤        numeric-constant≤        string-constant≤        identifier≤        color_class identifier≤ºæ≤
The most basic kinds of expressions are numeric and string constants.
Numeric constants are of type "int", and string constants are of
type "array of character".  However, EEL changes any expression of
type "array of ..." into a pointer to the beginning of the array (of
type "pointer to ...").  Thus a string constant
results in a pointer to its first character.

An identifier is a valid expression only if it has been previously
declared as a variable or function.  A variable of type "array of
..." is changed to a pointer to the beginning of the array, as
described above.

Some expressions are called ªlvalue expressionsº.
Roughly, lvalue expressions are expressions that refer to a
changeable location in memory.  For example, if foo is an integer
variable and func() is a function returning an integer, then
foo is an lvalue, but func() is not.  The & and .
operators, the ++ and ø operators, and all assignment
operators require their operands to be lvalues.  Only the *,
[ ], ->, and . operands return lvalues.

An identifier which refers to a variable is an lvalue if its type is
an integer, a spot, a pointer, a structure, or a union, but not if its type
is an array or function.

If an identifier has not been previously declared, and appears in a
function call as the name of the function, it is implicitly declared
to be a function returning an int.

If the name of a previously declared function appears in an
expression in any context other than as the function of a function
call, its value is a function pointer to the named function.
Function pointers may not point to primitive functions.

For example, if foo is previously undeclared, the statement
foo(1, 2); declares it as a function returning an int.  If
the next statement is return foo;, a pointer to the function
foo() will be returned.

Rcolor-class-syntaxOnce a color class newclass has been
declared, you can refer to it by using the special syntax
color_class newclass.  This provides a numeric code that refers
to the particular color class.  It's used in conjunction with the
primitives alter_color( ), add_region( ),
set_character_color( ), and others.  See Rcolclassπcolclass
for basic information on color classes, and Rcolorschemeπcolorscheme for information on declaring color classes in
EEL.

3Unary Operators

The ! operator yields one if its operand is zero, and zero
otherwise.  It can be applied to pointers, spots, or numbers, but its
result is always an int.

The unary * operator takes a pointer and yields the object it
points to.  If its operand has type "pointer to ...", the
result has type "...", and is an lvalue.  You can also apply
* to an operand of type "spot", and the result is a number (a
buffer position).

The unary & operator takes an lvalue and returns a pointer to it.
It is the inverse of the * operator, and its result has type
"pointer to ..." if its operand has type "...".  (You
cannot construct a spot by applying the & operator to a
position.  Use the alloc_spot( ) primitive described in Rspotπspot.)

The unary - and ~ operators work only on numbers.  The first
negates the given number, and the second flips all its bits, changing
ones to zeros and zeros to ones.

The sizeof operator yields the size in bytes of an object.  You can
specify the object as an expression or with a type name
(described in Rtypenameπtypename).  In the latter case,
sizeof returns the size in bytes of an object of that type.
Characters require one byte, shorts two bytes, and ints four
bytes.  An array of 10 ints requires 40 bytes, and this is the
number sizeof(int [10]) will give, not 10.

An expression with a parenthesized type name before it is a
ªcastº.  The cast converts the expression to the named type using the
rules in Rconversionsπconversions, and the result is of
that type.  Specify the type using a type name, described in Rtypenameπtypename.

The ++ and ø operators increment and decrement their lvalue
operands.  If the operator appears before its operand, the value of
the expression is the new value of the operand.  The expression
(++var) is the same as (var += 1), and (øvar) is the same
as (var -= 1).  You can apply these operators to pointers, in which
case they work as described under pointer addition below.

If the ++ or ø operators appear after their operand, the
operand is changed in the same way, but the value of the expression
is the value of the operand ªbeforeº the change.  Thus the expression
var++ has the same value as var, but var has a different
value when you reference it the next time.

3Simple Binary Operators

Ωªexpression:≤        expression + expression≤        expression - expression≤        expression * expression≤        expression / expression≤        expression ≥ expression≤        expression == expression≤        expression != expression≤        expression < expression≤        expression > expression≤        expression <= expression≤        expression >= expression≤        expression && expression≤        expression || expression≤        expression & expression≤        expression | expression≤        expression ^ expression≤        expression << expression≤        expression >> expression≤ºæ≤
The binary + operator, when applied to numbers, yields the sum of
the numbers.  One of its operands may also be a pointer to an object in
an array.  In this case, the result is a pointer to the same array,
offset by the number to another object in the array.  For example, if
p points to an object in an array, p + 1 points to the next
object in the array and p - 1 points to the previous object,
regardless of the object's type.

The binary - operator, when applied to numbers, yields the
difference of the numbers.  If the first operand is a pointer and the
second is a number, the rules for addition of pointers and numbers
apply.  For example, if p is a pointer, p - 3 is the same
as p + -3.

Both operands may also be pointers to objects in the same array.  In
this case the result is the difference between them, measured in
objects.  For example, if arr is an array of ten ints, p1
points to the third int, and p2 points to the eighth, then
p1 - p2 yields the int -5.  The result is undefined if the
operands are pointers to different arrays.

The binary * operator is for multiplication, and the /
operator is for division.  The latter truncates toward 0 if its
operands are positive, but the direction of truncation is undefined
if either operand is negative.  The % operator provides the
remainder of the division of its operands, and x % y is always
equal to x - (x / y) * y.  All three operators take only numbers
and yield ints.

The == operator yields one if its arguments are equal and zero
otherwise.  The arguments must either both be numbers, both spots, or
both pointers to objects of the same type.  However, if one argument
is the constant zero, the other may be a spot or any type of pointer,
and the expression yields one if the pointer is null, and zero otherwise.
The != operator is just like the == operator, but returns one
where == would return zero, and zero where == would return
one.  The result of either operator is always an int.

The <, >, <=, and >= operators have a value of one
when the first operand is less than, greater than, less than or equal
to, or greater than or equal to (respectively) the second operand.
The operands may both be numbers, they may be pointers to the same
array, or one may be a pointer or spot and the other zero.  In the
last case, Epsilon returns values based on the convention that a
null pointer or spot is equal to zero and a non-null one is greater
than zero.  The result is undefined if the operands are pointers to
different arrays of the same type, and it is an error if they are
pointers to different types of objects, or if one is a spot and the
other is neither a spot nor zero.

The && operator yields one if both operands are nonzero, and
zero otherwise.  Each operand may be a pointer, spot, or number.
Moreover, the first operand is evaluated first, and if it is zero,
the second operand will not be evaluated.  The result is an int.

The || operator yields one if either of its operands are nonzero,
and zero if both are zero.  Each operand may be a pointer, spot, or
number.  The first operand is evaluated first, and if it is nonzero,
the second operand will not be evaluated.  The result is an int.

The & operator yields the bitwise AND of its numeric operands.
The | and ^ operators yields the bitwise OR and XOR
(respectively) of their numeric operands.  The result for all three
is an int.  A bit in the result of an AND is on if both
corresponding bits in its operands are on.  A bit in the result of an
OR is on if either of the corresponding bits in its operands are on.
A bit in the result of an XOR is on if one of the corresponding bits
in its operands is on and the other is off.

The << operator yields the first operand with its bits shifted to
the left the number of times given by the right operand.  The
>> operator works similarly, but shifts to the right.  The former
fills with zero bits, and the latter fills with one bits if the first
operand was negative, and zero bits otherwise.  If the second operand
is negative or greater than 31, the result is undefined.  Both
operands must be numbers, and the result is an int.

3Assignment Operators

ΩªRmodopsexpression:≤        expression = expression≤        expression modify-operator expression≤≤modify-operator:≤        +=≤        -=≤        *=≤        /=≤        ≥=≤        &=≤        |=≤        ^=≤        <<=≤        >>=≤ºæ≤
The plain assignment operator = takes an lvalue (see Rlvaluesπlvalues) as its first operand.  The object referred to by
the lvalue is given the value of the second operand.  The types of
the operands may both be numbers, spots, or pointers to the same type
of object.  If the first operand is a pointer or spot and the second
is the constant zero, the pointer or spot is made null.  The value of
the expression is the new value of the first operand, and it has the
same type.

The other kinds of assignment operators are often used simply as
abbreviations.  For example, if a is a variable, a += (b) is
the same as a = a + (b).  However, the first operand of an
assignment is only evaluated once, so if it has side effects, they
will only occur once.

For example, suppose a is an array of integers with values 10,
20, 30, and so forth.  Suppose p() is a function that will return
a pointer to the first element of a the first time it's called,
then a pointer to the second element, and so forth.  After the
statement *p() += 3;, a will contain 13, 20, 30.  After
*p() = *p() + 3;, however, a is certain not to contain 13,
20, 30, since p() will never return a pointer to the same element
of a twice.  Because the order of evaluation is unspecified with
these operators, the exact result of the latter statement is
undefined (either 10, 13, 30 or 23, 20, 30).

The result of all these assignment statements is the new value of the
first operand, and will have the same type.  The special rules for
mixing pointers and ints with the + and - operators also
apply here.

3Function Calls

Ωªexpression:≤        expression ()≤        expression ( expression-list )≤≤expression-list:≤        expression≤        expression , expression-list≤ºæ≤
An expression followed by a parenthesized list of expressions
(arguments) is a function call.  Usually the first expression is the
name of a function, but it can also be an expression yielding a
function.  (The only operator that yields a function is the unary
* when applied to a function pointer.)  The type of the result is
the type of the returned value.  If the function returns no value,
the expression must appear in a place where its value is not used.
You may call any function recursively.

If an identifier that has not been previously declared appears as the
name of the function, it is implicitly declared to be a function
returning an int.

Each argument is evaluated and a copy of its value is passed to the
function.  Character and short arguments are converted to ints in
the process.  Aside from this, the number and type of arguments must
match the definition of the function.  The order of evaluation of the
arguments to a function is undefined.

Since only a copy of each parameter is passed to the function, a
simple variable cannot be altered if its name only appears as the
argument to a function.  To alter a variable, pass a pointer to it,
and have the function modify the object pointed to.  Since an array
is converted to a pointer whenever its name occurs, an array that is
passed to a function can indeed be altered by the function.  Numbers,
spots, and pointers may be parameters, but structures, unions, or
functions cannot be.  Pointers to such things are allowed, of course.

functionAn EEL function can call not just other EEL
functions, but also any of Epsilon's built-in functions, known as
primitives.  These are listed in the next chapter.  An EEL function
can also call a keyboard macro as a function.  The word "function"
refers to any of the various types of routines that a command written
in EEL can call.  These include other commands or subroutines
(themselves written in EEL), primitives that are built into Epsilon
and cannot be changed, and keyboard macros (see Rmacsπmacs).
Textual macros that are defined with the #define preprocessor
statement are ªnotº functions.

Each function may require a certain number of arguments and may
return a value of a particular type.  Keyboard macros, however, never
take arguments or return a value.

3Miscellaneous Operators

Ωªexpression:≤        expression ? expression : expression≤        expression , expression≤        expression [ expression ]≤        expression -> identifier≤        expression . identifier≤ºæ≤
The conditional operator ? : has three operands.  The first
operand is always evaluated first.  If nonzero, the second operand is
evaluated, and that is the value of the result.  Otherwise, the third
operand is evaluated, and that is the value of the result.  Exactly
one of the second and third operands is evaluated.  The first operand
may be a number, spot, or pointer.  The second and third operands may
either both be numbers, both spots, both pointers to the same type of
object, or one may be a pointer or spot and the other the constant
zero.  In the first case the result is an int, and in the last two
cases the result is a spot or a pointer of the same type.

The , operator first evaluates its first argument and throws away
the result.  It then evaluates its second argument, and the result
has that value and type.  In any context where a comma has a special
meaning (such as in a list of arguments), EEL assumes that any commas
it finds are used for that special meaning.

The [ ] operator is EEL's subscripting operator.  Because of the
special way that addition of a pointer and a number works, we can
define the subscripting operator in terms of other operators.  The
expression e1[e2] is the same as *((e1)+(e2)), and since
addition is commutative, also the same as e2[e1].  In practice,
subscripting works in the expected way.  Note that the first object
in an array has subscript 0, however.  One of the operands must be a
pointer and the other a number.  The type of the result is that of
the pointed-to object.

RstructexpThe . operator disassembles structures or unions.  Its operand is
an lvalue which is a structure or union.  After the . an
identifier naming one of the operand's members must appear.  The
result is an lvalue referring to that member.

The -> operator is an abbreviation for a dereference (unary
*) followed by a member selection as above.  Its operand is a
pointer to a structure or union, and it is followed by the name of
one of the structure's or union's members.  The result is an lvalue
referring to that member.  The expression strptr->membername is
the same as the expression (*strptr).membername.

2Constant Expressions

RconstexpA constant expression is an expression which does not contain certain
things.  It may not have references to variables, string constants, or
function calls.  No subexpressions may have a type of spot, structure,
union, array, or pointer.  It may have numeric constants, character
constants, and any operators that act on them, and the sizeof
operator may appear with any operand.

The term "the constant zero" means a constant expression whose value
is zero, not necessarily a numeric constant.

2Global Definitions

Ωªprogram:≤        global-definition≤        global-definition program≤≤global-definition:≤        function-definition≤        global-variable-definition≤        keytable-definition≤        typedef-definition≤        color-class-definition≤ºæ≤
Each file of EEL code consists of a series of definitions for global
variables and functions.  Global variable definitions have the same
format as local variable definitions.  The first definition of a
global variable Epsilon receives determines the initial value of the
variable, and later initializations have no effect, unless you use
the volatile keyword when defining the variable (see Rvolatileπvolatile).  If the first definition provides no explicit
initialization, the variable is filled with zeros or null pointers as
appropriate, depending on its type.

buffervariables, buffer-specific Ebuffer, EEL keywordbuffer, keywordYou can declare any global variable (except a key table or color
class) to be  buffer-specific by
placing the keyword buffer before
the type specifier.  When the definition is first read in, its
initializer determines the value of the variable for each buffer that
then exists, and also the default value of the variable.  Whenever
you create a new buffer (and hence a new copy of the buffer-specific
variable), the variable's value in that buffer is set to the default
value.

windowvariables, window-specific Ewindow, EEL keywordwindow, keywordSimilarly, you can declare any global variable except a key table or
color class to be
window-specific by placing the keyword window
 before the type specifier.  When the
definition is first read in, its initializer determines the value of
the variable for each window that then exists, and also the default
value of the variable.  Whenever you split a window in two, the new
window inherits its initial value for the window-specific variable
from the original window.  Epsilon uses the default value of a
window-specific variable when it creates the first tiled window while
starting up, and when it creates pop-up windows.

Rzeroedzeroed Ezeroed, EEL keywordEpsilon's ¬write-state command writes a new state
file containing all variables, EEL functions, macros, colors, and so
forth that Epsilon knows about.  The file includes the current values
of all numeric variables, all global character array variables, and
any structures or unions containing just these types.  But Epsilon
doesn't save the values of variables containing pointers or spots,
and sets these to zero as it writes a state file.  You can put the
zeroed keyword before the definition of a variable of any
type to tell Epsilon to zero that variable when it writes a state
file.

user Euser, EEL keywordIn commands like set-variable, Epsilon distinguishes between
user variables and system variables, and only shows the former in its
list of variables you can set.  By default, each global variable you
define is a system variable that users will not see.  Put the
user keyword before a variable's definition to make the
variable a user variable.

3Key Tables

keytablekey table≤ΩªRkeytablekeytable Ekeytable, EEL keywordkeytable-definition:≤        keytable keytable-list ;≤≤keytable-list:≤        identifier≤        identifier , keytable-list≤ºæ≤
A key table is a set of bindings,
one for each key on the keyboard, with keys modified by control, alt,
and shift counted as separate keys.  Various mouse actions and system
events are also represented by special key codes.  Each entry in the
key table contains a short integer, which is an index into the name
table.  In other words, each entry corresponds to a named Epsilon
object, either a command, subroutine, keyboard macro, or another key
table.

 PNUMKEYS, textual macro Eon, EEL keywordYou can declare a key table by using the
keytable keyword in place of the type specifier in a global
variable definition.  A key table definition can contain no
initialization, just keytable followed by a list of
comma-separated key table names and a semicolon.  A key table acts
like an array of πMNUMKEYS short ints, but you can also use it
in the on part of a function definition (as described below).
(The macro πMNUMKEYS, the number of possible keys, is defined in
eel.h.)

3Color Classes

RcolorschemeA color class specifies a particular pair of
foreground and background colors Epsilon should use on a certain part
of the screen, or when displaying a certain type of text.  For
example, Epsilon uses the color class c_keyword to display
keywords in C-like languages.  More precisely, the color class
specifies which foreground/background pair of colors to display under
each defined color scheme.  If the user selects a different color
scheme, Epsilon will immediately begin displaying C keywords using
the c_keyword color pair defined for the new scheme.

color_class Ecolor_class, EEL keywordBefore you use a color class in an expression like
set_character_color(pos1, pos2, color_class c_keyword);, you must
declare the color class (outside of any function definition) using
the color_class keyword:

Ωcolor_scheme Ecolor_scheme, EEL keywordcolor_class c_keyword;≤æ≤
When you declare a new color class, you may wish to specify
the colors to use for a particular color scheme using the
color_scheme keyword:

Ωcolor_class c_keyword color_scheme "standard-gui" black on white;≤color_class c_keyword color_scheme "standard-color" green on black;≤æ≤
If you have many color definitions all for the same color class, you
can use this syntax:

Ωcolor_class c_keyword {≤    color_scheme "standard-gui" black on white;≤    color_scheme "standard-color" green on black;≤};≤æ≤
Similarly, if you have many color definitions for the same color
scheme, you can avoid repeating it by writing:

Ωcolor_scheme "standard-gui" {≤    color_class c_keyword black on white;≤    color_class c_function blue on white;≤    color_class c_identifier black on white;≤};≤æ≤
To specify the particular foreground and background colors for a
color class (using the syntax »foreground… on »background…),
you can use these macros defined in eel.h:

ΩMMAKE_RGB() PMAKE_RGB(), textual macro#define black           MAKE_RGB(0, 0, 0)≤#define dark_red        MAKE_RGB(128, 0, 0)≤#define dark_green      MAKE_RGB(0, 128, 0)≤#define brown           MAKE_RGB(128, 128, 0)≤// etc.≤æ≤
See that file for the current list of named colors.  These functions
use the MAKE_RGB() macro, providing particular values for
red, green, and blue.  You can use this macro yourself, in a color
class definition, to specify precise colors:

Ωcolor_scheme "my-color-scheme" {≤    color_class c_keyword MAKE_RGB(223, 47, 192) on yellow;≤};≤æ≤
There are several other macros useful in color definitions:

ΩMGETRED()MGETGREEN()MGETBLUE() PGETRED(), textual macro PGETGREEN(), textual macro PGETBLUE(), textual macro PETRANSPARENT, textual macro#define MAKE_RGB(rd,grn,bl)     ((rd) + ((grn) << 8) + ((bl) << 16))≤#define GETRED(rgb)             ((rgb) & 0xff)≤#define GETGREEN(rgb)           (((rgb) >> 8) & 0xff)≤#define GETBLUE(rgb)            (((rgb) >> 16) & 0xff)≤#define ETRANSPARENT            (0x1000000L)≤æ≤
The GETRED(), GETGREEN(), and GETBLUE()
macros take a color expression created with πMMAKE_RGB( ) and
extract one of its three components, which are always numbers from 0
to 255.

The πMETRANSPARENT macro is a special code that may be used
in place of a background color.  It tells Epsilon to substitute the
background color of the "text" color class in the current color
scheme.  The following three examples are all equivalent:

Ωcolor_class text color_scheme "standard-gui" yellow on red;≤color_class c_keyword color_scheme "standard-gui" blue on red;≤≤color_class text color_scheme "standard-gui" yellow on red;≤color_class c_keyword color_scheme "standard-gui" blue on ETRANSPARENT;≤≤color_class text color_scheme "standard-gui" yellow on red;≤color_class c_keyword color_scheme "standard-gui" blue;≤æ≤
The last example works because you may omit the on
»background… part from the syntax »foreground… on
»background…, and just specify a foreground color.  Epsilon
interprets this as if you typed on transparent, and substitutes
the background color specified for "text".

You can also specify that a particular color class is the same as a
previously-defined color class, like this:

Ωcolor_scheme "standard-gui" {≤    color_class text black on white;≤    color_class tex_text = color_class text;≤};≤æ≤
When, for the current scheme, there's no specific color information
for a color class, Epsilon looks for a default color class
specification, one that's not associated with any scheme:

Ωcolor_class diff_added black on yellow;≤color_class c_string cyan;≤color_class c_charconst = color_class c_string;≤æ≤
The first definition above says that, in the absense of any
color-scheme-specific setting for the diff_added color class, it
should be displayed as black text on a yellow background.  The second
says that text in the c_string color class should be displayed
using cyan text, on the default background for the scheme (that
defined for the text color class).  And the third says that text
in the c_charconst color class should be displayed the same as
text in the c_string color class for that scheme.

Internally, Epsilon stores all color class settings that occur
outside any color scheme in a special color scheme, which is named
"color-defaults".

A function definition begins with a type specifier, the name of the
function, and parentheses surrounding a comma-separated list of
arguments.  Any bindings may be given here using the on keyword,
as described below.  Declarations for the arguments then appear, and
the body of the function follows.  If the command keyword appears
before the type specifier, the function is a command, and Epsilon
will do completion on the function when it asks for the name of a
command.  A function may be a command only if it has no arguments.

You may omit the type specifier before the function name, in which
case the function's type is int.  You may also omit the
declaration for any
argument, in which case the argument will be an int.
Note that unlike some languages such as Pascal, if there
are no arguments, an empty pair of parentheses must still appear,
both in the definition and where you call the function.

You may also define functions using ANSI C/C++ syntax, in which type
information for function arguments appears with the argument names
inside parentheses.  These function headers have the same effect:

Ωaverage(int count, short *values)≤æ≤≤ΩRargtypeaverage(count, values)≤short *values;≤æ≤

When you call a function, arguments of type char or short are
automatically changed to ints.  A corresponding change happens to
declarations of function arguments and return values.  Additionally,
function arguments declared as an array of some type are changed to
be a pointer to the same type, just as array variables are changed to
pointers to the start of the array when their names appear in
expressions (see Rarraytoptrπarraytoptr).  For example, these two
function headers have the same effect.

Ωshort average(count, values)≤char count;≤short values[ ];≤æ≤≤ΩonRnoextern Eon, EEL keywordaverage(count, values)≤short *values;≤æ≤

The user can call any function which takes no arguments, or bind such
a function to a key.  Functions which are normally invoked in this
way can be made commands with the command keyword, but this is
not necessary.  If you omit the command keyword, Epsilon will not
perform command completion on the function's name.  The on
keyword can appear after the (empty) parentheses of a function's
argument list, to provide bindings for the function.  Each binding
consists of a key table name, followed by a constant (the key number)
in square brackets [ ].  There may be several bindings following
the on keyword, separated by commas.  You must have previously
declared the key table name in the same file (or an #included
file).  The binding takes effect when you load the function.

Sometimes it is necessary to declare an
identifier as a function, although
the function is actually defined in a separately
compiled source file.  For example, you must declare a function
before you use a pointer to that function.  Also, the EEL compiler must know
that a function returns a non-numeric type if its return value is
used.  Any declaration of an identifier with type ªfunction
returning ...º is a function declaration.  Function declarations may
appear anywhere a local or global variable declaration is legal.  So
long as the identifier is not masked by a local variable of the same
name, the declaration has effect until the end of the file.

 Pwhen_loading(), subroutineAny function named when_loading( ) is automatically executed when
you load the bytecode file it appears in into Epsilon.  There may be
any number of when_loading() functions defined in a file, and they
execute in order, while the file is being loaded.  Such functions are
deleted as soon as they return.  They may take no arguments.

2Differences Between EEL And C

Rnotc

 Global variables may not be initialized with any expression involving
pointers.  This includes strings, which may only be used to directly
initialize a declared array of characters.  That is,

°Ωchar example[ ] = "A string.";æ

°is legal, while

°Ωchar *example = "A string.";æ

°is not.

 There are no static variables or functions.  All local variables
vanish when the function returns, and all global objects have names
that separately compiled files can refer to.

 The C reserved word "extern" does not exist.  In EEL, you may define
variables multiple times with no problems, as long as they
are declared to have the same type.  The first definition read into
Epsilon provides the initialization of the variable, and further
initializations have no effect.  However, if the variable is later declared
with a different size, the size changes and the new
initialization takes effect. To declare a function without defining it in
a particular source file, see Rnoexternπnoextern.

 The C types "long", "enum", "void", "float", and
"double" do not exist.  Ints and shorts are always signed.  Chars
are always unsigned.  There are no C bit fields.  The C reserved
words "long", "float", and "double" are not reserved in EEL.

 EEL provides the basic data type spot, and understands
color class expressions and declarations using the color_class
and color_scheme keywords.

 EEL does not have the structure assignment features of ANSI C.

 You may not cast between pointers and ints, except that
function pointers may be cast to shorts, and vice versa.  The
constant zero may be cast to any pointer type.  A pointer may be cast
to a pointer of another type, with the exception of function pointers.

  Ekeytable, EEL keywordYou can use the reserved word keytable to declare empty
key tables, as in

°Ωcommand, eel keyword Eon, EEL keywordkeytable reg_tab, cx_tab;æ

°Local key tables are not permitted.

 The reserved word command
is syntactically like a storage class.  Use it to indicate that the
function is normally called by the user, so command completion will
work.  The user can also call other functions (as long as they have
no arguments) but the completion facility on command names ignores
them.

 After the head of any function definition with no arguments,
you can use the reserved word on to give a binding.  It is
followed by the name of a key table already declared, and an index
(constant int expression) in square brackets.  There may be more than
one (separated by commas).  For example,

°Ωbuffer, keywordwindow, keywordcommand visit_file() on cx_tab[CTRL('V')]æ

 You can use the reserved word buffer
as a storage class for global variables.  It declares a
variable to have a different value for each buffer, plus a default
value.  As you switch between buffers, a reference to a
buffer-specific variable will refer to a different value.

 You can also use the reserved word
window as a storage class for global variables.  This declares
the variable to have a different value for each window, plus a
default value.  As you switch between windows, a reference to a
window-specific variable will refer to a different value.

 The reserved words zeroed and user do not exist in
C.  See Rzeroedπzeroed.  The reserved word volatile does
exist in ANSI C, but serves a different purpose in EEL.  See Rvolatileπvolatile.

 The EEL statements save_var and save_spot do not
exist in C.  See Rsavevarπsave-var.

include preprocessor command, executed only once In each compile, an include file with a certain name is only read
once, even if there are several #include directives that request
it.

1Primitives and EEL Subroutines
primitiveRprim∆Primitives

”CprimIn this chapter, we describe all EEL primitives, as well
as a few useful EEL subroutines.  In Epsilon, the term "primitive"
refers to a function or variable that is not written or defined in
EEL, but rather built into Epsilon.

Each section discusses items that pertain to a particular topic, and
begins with EEL declarations for the items discussed in that section.
If we implemented an item as an EEL subroutine, the declaration often
includes a comment that identifies the EEL source file defining the
item.

Some EEL primitives have optional parameters.  For example, you can
call the get_tail() primitive as either get_tail(fname, 1)
or get_tail(fname).  Any missing parameter automatically takes a
value of zero.  In this manual, we indicate an optional parameter by
showing a ? before it.

When writing EEL extensions, an easy way to look up the documentation
on the primitive or subroutine at point is to press F1 F ⁄Enter€.

2Buffer Primitives
3Changing Buffer Contents

 Pinsert(), primitiveinsert()Ωinsert(int ch)≤user buffer int point;≤æ≤
An Epsilon ªbufferº contains text that you can edit.
Most of the primitives in this section act on, or refer to,
one of the buffers designated as the ªcurrent bufferº.

The insert( ) primitive inserts a single character into the
current buffer.  Its argument says what character to insert.  The
buffer's insertion point, or just point, refers to the particular
position in each buffer where insertions occur.

The int variable named point≈point stores this position.  Its
value denotes the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer
to the spot at which insertions happen.  For example, a value of
zero for point means that insertions would occur at the beginning of
the buffer.  A value of one for point means that insertions
would occur after the first character, etc.

To change the insertion point, you can assign a new value
to point.  For example, the statement

Ωpoint = 3;æ

makes insertions occur after the third character in
the buffer, assuming the buffer has at least 3 characters.  If you
set point to a value less than zero, point takes the value
zero.  Similarly, if you set point to a value greater than the
size of the buffer, its value becomes the number of characters in the
buffer.

When the current buffer changes, the value of the variable point
automatically changes with it.  We call variables with this behavior
ªbuffer-specificº variables.  See Rbufspecvarπbufspecvar.

Ωsize()Rposition Psize(), primitivepositionint size()≤æ≤
The primitive function size( ) returns the number of characters
in the current buffer.  You cannot set the size directly: you can
change the size of the buffer only by inserting or deleting
characters.  For this reason, we implemented size( )≈size() as a
function, not a variable like point≈point.

The variable point refers not to a character position, but
rather to a character boundary, a place between characters (or at the
beginning or end of a buffer).  The legal values for point range from
zero to size( ).  We will refer to a value in this range,
inclusive of the ends, as a ªpositionº.  A
position is a place between characters in a buffer, or at the
beginning of the buffer, or at the end.  The value of a position is
the number of characters before it in the buffer.  In EEL, ints
(integers) hold positions.

When Epsilon inserts a character, it goes before point, not after it.
If Epsilon didn't work this way, inserting a, then b, then c would
result in cba, not abc.

Ωdelete()delete_if_highlighted() Pdelete(), primitive Pdelete_if_highlighted(), subroutinedelete(int pos1, int pos2)≤int delete_if_highlighted()≤æ≤
The delete( ) primitive deletes all characters between the two
positions supplied as arguments to it.  The order of the arguments
doesn't matter.

The delete( ) primitive doesn't save deleted text in a kill
buffer.  The kill commands themselves manage the kill buffers,
and use the delete( ) primitive to actually remove the text.

Commands that insert text often begin by calling the
delete_if_highlighted( ) subroutine.  If there's a
highlighted region, this subroutine deletes it and returns 1.
Otherwise (or if the typing-deletes-highlight variable has been
set to zero), it returns 0.

Ωreplace()character()curchar() Preplace(), primitive Pcharacter(), primitive Pcurchar(), primitivereplace(int pos, int ch)≤int character(int pos)≤int curchar()≤æ≤
The replace( ) primitive changes the character at position
pos to ch.  The parameter pos refers to the position
before the character in question.  Therefore, the value of pos
can range from 0 to size()-1, inclusively.

The character( ) primitive returns the character after the
position specified by its argument, pos.  The curchar( )
returns the same value as character(point).  These two primitives
return -1 when the position involved isn't valid, such as at the
end of the buffer or before its start (when pos is less than
zero).  For example, character(size()) returns -1, as does
curchar( ) with point at the end of the buffer.

The stuff( ) function inserts an entire string into the current
buffer.

The bprintf( ) function also inserts a string, but it takes a
format string plus other arguments and builds the string to insert
using the rules in Rprintfπprintf.  The buffer_printf( )
functions similarly, except that it takes the name of
the buffer into which to insert the string.  It creates the
buffer if necessary.  Similarly,
buf_printf( ) takes a buffer number, and inserts the formatted
string into that buffer.  All of the primitives described in this
paragraph return the number of characters they inserted into the
buffer.

The xfer( ) subroutine transfers characters from one buffer
to another.  It copies the characters between from and to in
the current buffer and inserts them at point in the named buffer.  It
positions the mark in the named buffer just before the inserted
characters, and positions its point right after the insertion.
The current buffer doesn't change.  The buf_xfer( )
subroutine works similarly, but accepts a buffer number instead of a
name.  Both use the raw_xfer( ) primitive to transfer the
text.

The buf_xfer_colors( ) subroutine is
like buf_xfer( ), but copies any colors set by
set_character_color( )≈set_character_color() as well.

grab_buffer() Pgrab_buffer(), subroutineThe grab_buffer( ) subroutine copies text in the other

current buffer before point, setting the mark before the inserted
text.

The grab( ) primitive copies characters from the buffer to a
string.  It takes the range of characters to copy, and a character
pointer indicating where to copy them.  The buffer doesn't change.
The positions may be in either order.  The resulting string will be
null-terminated.

The grab_expanding( ) subroutine is similar, but works with
a dynamically allocated character pointer, not a fixed-length
character array.  Pass a pointer to a char * variable, and the
subroutine will resize it as needed to hold the result.  The char
* variable may hold NULL initially.  The minlen parameter
provides a minimum allocation length for the result.

The grab_full_line( ) subroutine copies the entire current line
of buffer number bnum into the character array str.  It
doesn't change point.  The grab_line( ) subroutine copies the
remainder of bnum's current line to str, and moves to the
start of the next line.  Neither function copies the ⁄Newline€ at
the end of the line, and each returns the number of characters copied.

Ωgrab_numbers() Pgrab_numbers(), subroutineint grab_numbers(int bnum, int *nums)    /* buffer.e */≤æ≤
The grab_numbers( ) subroutine uses grab_line( ) to
retrieve a line from buffer bnum.  Then it breaks the line into
words (separated by spaces and tabs), and tries to interpret each
word as a number by calling the numtoi( ) subroutine.  It puts
the resulting numbers in the array nums.  The function returns
the number of words on the line.

The grab_string( ) subroutine copies from buffer bnum into
s.  It copies from the buffer's current position to the
beginning of the next occurrence of the text endmark, and leaves
the buffer's point after that text.  It returns 1, unless it
couldn't find the endmark text.  In that case, it moves to the
end of the buffer, sets s to the empty string, and returns
0.

The grab_string_expanding( ) subroutine is similar, but
works with dynamically allocated character pointers, not fixed-length
character arrays.  Pass a pointer to a char * variable, and the
subroutine will resize it as needed to hold the result.  The char
* variable may hold NULL initially.  The minlen parameter
provides a minimum allocation length for the result.

3Spots

spotRspotΩspot alloc_spot(?int left_ins)≤free_spot(spot sp)≤int spot_to_buffer(spot sp)≤æ≤
A place in the buffer is usually recorded and saved for
later use as a count of the characters before that place: this is a
position, as described in Rpositionπposition.  Sometimes it is
important for the stored location to remain between the same pair of
characters even if many changes are made to other parts of the buffer
(affecting the number of characters before the saved location).

Epsilon provides a type of variable called a ªspotº for
this situation.  The declaration

Ω        alloc_spot()free_spot()spot_to_buffer() Palloc_spot(), primitive Pfree_spot(), primitive Pspot_to_buffer(), primitivespot sp;≤æ≤
says that sp can refer to a spot.  It doesn't create a new
spot itself, though.

The alloc_spot( ) primitive creates a new spot and returns it,
and the free_spot( ) primitive takes a spot and discards it.
The spot that alloc_spot( ) returns is initially set to point,
and is associated with the current buffer.  Deleting a buffer frees
all spots associated with it.  If you try to free a spot whose buffer
has already been deleted, Epsilon will ignore the request, and will
not signal an error.

The spot_to_buffer( ) primitive takes a spot and returns the
buffer number it was created for, or -1 if the buffer no longer
exists, or -2 if the buffer exists, but that particular spot has
since been deleted.

If the left_ins parameter to alloc_spot( ) is nonzero, a
left-inserting spot is created.  If the left_ins parameter is 0,
or is omitted, a right-inserting spot is created.  The only
difference between the two types of spots is what they do when
characters are inserted right where the spot is.  A left-inserting
spot stays after such inserted characters, while a right-inserting
spot stays before them.  For example, imagine an empty buffer, with
all spots at 0.  After five characters are inserted, any
left-inserting spots will be at the end of the buffer, while
right-inserting spots will remain at the beginning.

A spot as returned by alloc_spot( ) behaves a little like a
pointer to an int, in that you must dereference it by writing
*sp to obtain the position it currently refers to.  For example:

Ω Esave_spot, EEL keywordfill_all()      /* fill paragraphs, leave point alone */≤{≤spot oldpos = alloc_spot(), oldmark = alloc_spot();≤≤*oldpos = point;≤*oldmark = mark;        /* save old values */≤point = 0;              /* make region be whole buffer */≤mark = size();≤fill_region();          /* fill paragraphs in region */≤mark = *oldmark;        /* restore values */≤point = *oldpos;≤free_spot(oldmark);     /* free saving places */≤free_spot(oldpos);≤}≤æ≤
A simpler way to write the above subroutine uses EEL's
save_spot keyword.  The save_spot keyword takes care of
allocating spots, saving the original values, and restoring those
values when the subroutine exits.  See Rsavevarπsave-var for
more on save_spot.

Ωfill_all()      /* fill paragraphs, leave point alone */≤{               /* uses save_spot */≤save_spot point = 0;              /* make region be whole buffer */≤save_spot mark = size();≤fill_region();          /* fill paragraphs in region */≤}≤æ≤
Like a pointer, a spot variable can contain zero, and
alloc_spot( ) is guaranteed never to return this value.  Epsilon
signals an error if you try to dereference a spot which has been
freed, or whose buffer no longer exists.

ΩRmarkpoint_spotmark_spot Ppoint_spot, primitive Pmark_spot, primitivebuffer spot point_spot;≤buffer spot mark_spot;≤#define point   *point_spot≤#define mark    *mark_spot≤/* These variables are actually defined≤   differently.  See below. */≤æ≤

Each new buffer begins with two spots, point_spot and
mark_spot, set to the beginning of the buffer.
Point_spot is a left-inserting spot, while mark_spot is a
right-inserting spot.  These spots are created automatically with
each new buffer, and you cannot free them.  You can think of the
built-in variables point and mark≈mark as simply macros that
yield *point_spot and *mark_spot, respectively.  That's why
you don't need to put a * before each reference to point.

Ωget_spot() Pget_spot(), primitiveuser buffer int point;       /* True definitions */≤user buffer int mark;≤spot get_spot(int which)≤#define point_spot      get_spot(0)≤#define mark_spot       get_spot(1)≤æ≤
Actually, while point and mark could be defined as macros,
as above, they're not.  Epsilon recognizes them as built-in
primitives for speed.  On the other hand, point_spot and
mark_spot actually are macros!  They use the get_spot( )
primitive, which has no function other than to return these two
values.

Ωdo_set_mark() Pdo_set_mark(), subroutinedo_set_mark(int val)≤æ≤
The do_set_mark( ) subroutine sets the current buffer's mark to
the specified value.  It also records the current virtual column
(which, typically, should match the mark).  The rectangle commands
retrieve this, so that in virtual mode you can copy rectangles that
end in virtual space.

3Narrowing

Ωuser buffer int narrow_start;≤user buffer int narrow_end;≤int narrow_position(int p)      /* buffer.e */≤æ≤
Epsilon provides two primitive variables, narrow_start≈narrow_start and
narrow_end≈narrow_end, that restrict access to the current buffer.  The
commands narrow-to-region and widen-buffer, described
in Rnarrowingπnarrowing, use these variables.  Epsilon ignores
the first narrow_start characters and the last narrow_end
characters of the buffer.  Usually, these variables have a value of
zero, so no such restriction takes place.  Characters outside of the
narrowed region will not appear on the screen, and will remain
outside the control of normal Epsilon commands.

If you try to set a primitive variable such as point to a
position outside of the narrowed area, Epsilon will change the value
to one inside the narrowed area.  For example, suppose the buffer
contains one hundred characters, with the first and last ten
characters excluded, so only eighty appear on the screen.
In this case, size( ) will return one hundred, and
narrow_start and narrow_end will each have a value of ten.
The statement point = 3; will give point a value of ten (the
closest legal value), while the statement point = 10000; will
give point the value ninety.  Epsilon adjusts the parameters of
primitive functions in the same way.  Suppose, in the example above,
you try to delete all the characters in the buffer, using the
delete( ) primitive.  Epsilon would take the statement
delete(0, size()); and effectively change it to
delete(10, 90); to delete only the characters inside
the narrowed area.

narrow_position() Pnarrow_position(), subroutineThe narrow_position( ) subroutine returns its argument p,
adjusted so that it's inside the narrowed buffer boundaries.

Writing the buffer to a file ignores narrowing.  Reading a file into
the buffer lifts any narrowing in effect by setting narrow_start
and narrow_end to zero.

3Undo Primitives

With a nonzero argument, the undo_op( ) primitive undoes one
basic operation like the undo command, described in Rundoπundo.  With an argument of zero, it acts like redo.
It returns a bit pattern describing what types of operations were
undone or redone.  The bit codes are defined in codes.h.
UNDO_INSERT means that originally an insertion occurred, and it
was either undone or redone.  The UNDO_DELETE and
UNDO_REPLACE codes are similar.

Epsilon groups individual buffer changes into groups, and undoes one
group at a time.  While saving changes for undoing, Epsilon begins a
new group when it redisplays buffers or when it begins a new command in
the main loop.  The UNDO_REDISP code indicates the former
happened, and UNDO_MAINLOOP the latter.  UNDO_MOVE
indicates movement is being undone, and UNDO_END is used when
Epsilon could only undo part of a command.  If undo_op( ) returns
zero, the buffer was not collecting undo information (see below).

undo_redisplay()undo_mainloop() Pundo_redisplay(), primitive Pundo_mainloop(), primitiveEpsilon automatically starts a new undo group each time it does
normal redisplay or passes through its main loop, by calling either
the undo_redisplay( ) or undo_mainloop( ) primitives,
respectively.  You can call either of these primitives yourself to
make Epsilon start a new undo group.

In addition to starting a new group, the undo_mainloop( )
primitive also makes the current buffer start to collect undo
information.  When you first create a buffer, Epsilon doesn't keep
undo information for it, so that "system" buffers don't have this
unnecessary overhead.  Each time it passes through the main loop,
Epsilon calls undo_mainloop( ), and this makes the current buffer
start collecting undo information, if it isn't already, and if the
buffer-specific variable undo_size is nonzero.

Ωundo_count() Pundo_count(), primitiveint undo_count(int is_undo)≤æ≤
The undo_count( ) primitive takes a parameter that specifies
whether undoing or redoing is involved, like undo_op( ).  The
primitive returns a value indicating how much undoing or redoing
information is saved.  The number doesn't correspond to a particular
number of commands, but to their complexity.

ΩMUNDO_FLAG PUNDO_FLAG, textual macrouser buffer int undo_flag;≤æ≤
In addition to buffer changes and movements, Epsilon can record other
information in its list of undoable operations.  Each time you set
the undo_flag≈undo_flag variable, Epsilon inserts a "flag" in its undo
list with the particular value you specify.  When Epsilon is undoing
or redoing and encounters a flag, it immediately ends the current
group of undo operations and returns a code with the UNDO_FLAG
bit on.  It puts the value of the flag it encountered in the
undo_flag variable.  The yank-pop command uses flags 1
and 2 for undoing the previous yank.

3Searching Primitives

Ωuser int matchstart;≤user int matchend;≤int search(int dir, char *str)≤user short abort_searching;≤#define ABORT_JUMP      -1≤#define ABORT_ERROR     -2≤æ≤
The search primitives each look for the first occurrence of some text
in a particular direction from point.  Use 1 to specify forward,
-1 to specify backward.  They move point to the far end of the
match, and set the matchstart≈matchstart and matchend≈matchend variables to
the near and far ends of the match, respectively.  For example, if
the buffer contains "abcd" and you search backward from the end for
"bc", point and matchend will be 1 (between the "a" and the
"b") and matchstart will be 3.  If the search text does not
appear in the buffer, point goes to the appropriate end of the
buffer.  These primitives return 1 if they find the text and
0 if not.

search() Psearch(), primitiveThe most basic searching function is the search( ) primitive.
It takes a direction and a string, and searches for the string.  It
returns 1 if it finds the text, or 0 if it does not.

Rabort-searchingMABORT_JUMPMABORT_ERROR PABORT_JUMP, textual macro PABORT_ERROR, textual macroIf the user presses the abort key during
searching, Epsilon's behavior depends upon the value of the
abort_searching≈abort_searching variable.  If it's 0, the key is ignored
and the search continues.  If it's ABORT_JUMP (the
default), Epsilon aborts the search and jumps by calling the
check_abort( ) primitive.  If it's ABORT_ERROR, Epsilon
aborts the search and returns the value ABORT_ERROR.  The
search( ), re_search( ), re_match( ), and
buffer_sort( ) primitives all use the abort_searching
variable to control aborting.

4Case Folding

 V_srch_case_map, buffer-specific variable_srch_case_mapRsrchmapΩuser buffer short case_fold;≤buffer char *_srch_case_map;≤æ≤
If the ¬case-fold≈case-fold buffer-specific variable is nonzero,
characters that match except for case count as a match.  Otherwise, only
exact matches (including case) count.

Epsilon determines how to fold characters by looking
up each character in the buffer-specific variable
_srch_case_map.  The _srch_case_map variable is a pointer
to an array of 256 characters.  When Epsilon must compare two
characters, and case-folding is on, it runs each character through
_srch_case_map first.  Most characters in this array map to
themselves, but lower case letters are set to map to upper case
letters instead.  For example, _srch_case_map['a'] and
_srch_case_map['A'] are both equal to "A", so these characters
match.  Epsilon initializes the _srch_case_map array in the file
epsilon.e to reflect the characters available on a normal IBM
display.  Since this variable is a buffer-specific pointer, you can
have different rules for case folding in different buffers.

strfcmp()strnfcmp()charfcmp() Pstrfcmp(), primitive Pstrnfcmp(), primitive Pcharfcmp(), primitiveEpsilon uses the _srch_case_map array for all its searching
primitives, during sorting, and in the primitives strfcmp( ),
strnfcmp( ), and charfcmp( ), unless the case_fold
variable is 0 in the current buffer.

4Regular Expression Searching

 Pre_search(), primitiveregular expressionsre_search()Ωint re_search(int flags, char *pat)≤int re_compile(int flags, char *pat)≤int re_match()≤#define RE_FORWARD      0≤#define RE_REVERSE      2≤#define RE_FIRST_END    4≤#define RE_SHORTEST     8≤æ≤

Several searching primitives deal with a
powerful kind of pattern known as a ªregular expressionº.  Regular
expressions allow you to search for complex patterns.  Regular
expressions are strings formed according to the rules in Rregexπregex.

The re_search( ) primitive searches the buffer for one of these
patterns.  It operates like the search( )≈search() primitive, taking a
direction and pattern and returning 1 if it finds the pattern.  It
moves to the far end of the pattern from the starting point, and sets
matchstart≈matchstart to the near end.  If it doesn't find the pattern,
or if the pattern is illegal, it returns 0.  In the latter case point
doesn't move, in the former point moves to the end (or beginning) of
the buffer.

When you specify a direction using 1 or -1, Epsilon selects
the first-ending, longest match, unless the search string overrides
this.  However, instead of providing a direction (1 or -1)
as the first parameter to re_search( ) or re_compile( ), you
can provide a set of flags.  These let you specify finding the
shortest possible match, for example, without altering the search
string.

MRE_FORWARDMRE_REVERSEMRE_FIRST_ENDMRE_SHORTEST PRE_FORWARD, textual macro PRE_REVERSE, textual macro PRE_FIRST_END, textual macro PRE_SHORTEST, textual macroThe RE_FORWARD flag searches forward, while the
RE_REVERSE flag searches backward.  (If you don't include
either, Epsilon searches forward.)  The RE_FIRST_END flag says
to find a match that ends first, rather than one that begins first.
The RE_SHORTEST flag says to find the shortest possible match,
rather than the longest.  However, if the search string contains
sequences that specify first-ending, first-beginning, shortest, or
longest matches, those sequences override any flags.

re_compile()re_match() Pre_compile(), primitive Pre_match(), primitiveThe re_compile( ) primitive checks a pattern for legality.  It
takes the same arguments as re_search( )≈re_search() and returns 1 if the pattern is
illegal, otherwise 0.  The re_match( ) primitive tells if the
last-compiled pattern matches at this location in the buffer, returning
the far end of the match if it does, or -1 if it does not.

Ωparse_string()matches_at() Pparse_string(), primitive Pmatches_at(), subroutineint parse_string(int flags, char *pat, ?char *dest)≤int matches_at(int pos, int dir, char *pat)≤æ≤
The parse_string( ) primitive looks for a match starting at
point, using the same rules as re_match( )≈re_match().  It takes a
direction (or flags) and a pattern like re_compile( )≈re_compile(), and a
character pointer.  It looks for a match of the pattern beginning at
point, and returns the length of such a match, or zero if there was
no match.

The third argument dest may be a null pointer, or may be omitted
entirely.  But if it's a pointer to a character array,
parse_string( ) copies the characters of the match there, and
moves point past them.  If the pattern does not match, dest isn't
modified.

The matches_at( ) subroutine uses parse_string( ).  It
accepts a regular expression pat and returns nonzero if the given
pattern matches at a particular position in the buffer.

Ωfind_group() Pfind_group(), primitiveint find_group(int n, int open)≤æ≤
The find_group( ) primitive tells where in the buffer
certain parts of the last pattern matched.  It counts opening
parentheses used for grouping in the last pattern, numbered from 1,
and returns the position it was at when it reached a certain
parenthesis.  If open is nonzero, it returns the position of the
n'th left parenthesis, otherwise it returns the position of its
matching right parenthesis.  If n is zero, it returns information
on the whole pattern.  If n is too large, or negative, the
primitive aborts with an error message.

The do_searching( ) subroutine defined in search.e is handy
when you want to use a variable to determine the type of search.  A
flags value of 0 means perform a plain forward search.  The
flags REVERSE, REGEX, and WORD specify
a reverse search, a regular expression search, or a word search,
respectively.  The subroutine normally performs case-folding if the
buffer's case_fold variable is non-zero; pass MODFOLD
to force Epsilon to search without case-folding, or pass
MODFOLD and FOLD to force Epsilon to case-fold.  The
above flags may be combined in any combination.

The do_searching( ) subroutine returns 1 on a successful
search, or 0 if the search text was not found.  It can also
return DSABORT if the user aborted the search (see the
abort_searching variable) or DSBAD if the (regular
expression) search pattern was invalid.  If the search was successful,
Epsilon moves to just after the found text (or just before, for

If do_searching( ) needs to search in word mode, it calls the
word_search( ) subroutine.  This function searches for
str, rejecting matches unless they are preceded and followed by
non-word characters.  It uses the subroutines
is_word_char( ) and check_buffer_word( ) to provide
its definition of a word.  The is_word_char( ) subroutine tells
if the character at a certain position in the buffer is part of a
word.  The check_buffer_word( ) subroutine returns nonzero if
the characters before and after the specified range are both non-word
characters.

The narrowed_search( ) subroutine is like
do_searching( ), but takes a parameter limit to limit the
search.  Epsilon will only search a region of the buffer within
limit characters of its starting point.  For example, if point is
at 30000 and you call narrowed_search( ) and specify a reverse
search with a limit of 1000, the match must occur between
positions 29000 and 30000.  If no such match is found, point will be
set to 29000 and the function will return 0.

Ωstring_replace()MINCRMQUERYshow_replace() Pstring_replace(), subroutine PINCR, textual macro PQUERY, textual macro Pshow_replace(), subroutinestring_replace(char *str, char *with, int flags)≤show_replace(char *str, char *with, int flags)≤æ≤
The string_replace( ) subroutine allows you to do string
replacements from within a function.  It accepts flags from the same
list as do_searching( ).  Provide the INCR flag if you
want the subroutine to display the number of matches it found, and
the number that were replaced.  Provide the QUERY flag to
ask the user to confirm each replacement.  This subroutine sets the
variables ¬replace-num-found≈replace-num-found and ¬replace-num-changed≈replace-num-changed to
indicate the total number of replacements it found, and the number
the user elected to change.

If you want to display what will be replaced without replacing
anything, call the show_replace( ) subroutine.  It takes the
same parameters as string_replace( ), and displays a message in
the echo area.  All Epsilon's replacing commands call this subroutine
to display their messages.

Ωsimple_re_replace() Psimple_re_replace(), subroutinesimple_re_replace(int dir, char *str, char *repl)≤æ≤
The simple_re_replace( ) subroutine performs a regular
expression replacement on the current buffer.  It searches through
the buffer, starting from the top, and passing dir and str
directly to the re_search( ) primitive.  It deletes each match
and inserts the string repl instead.  The replacement text is
inserted literally, with no interpolation.  If you want to use
#1 in your replacement text, get a count of the matches, or
other more involved things, call string_replace( ) instead.

To ask the user for a search string, use the search_read( )
subroutine.  Its parameter str provides an initial search string,
and it returns a set of flags which you can pass to
do_searching( ).  It takes an initial set of flags, which you
can use to start the user in one of the searching modes.  Call
default_fold( ) with any flags before calling
search_read( ).  It will turn on any needed flags relating to
case-folding, based on the value of the case_fold variable, and
return a modified set of flags.

The function leaves the string in either the _default_search or
the _default_regex_search variable, depending upon the searching
flags it returns.  You can call the default_search_string( )
subroutine with that set of searching flags and it will return a
pointer to the appropriate one of these.

get_search_string() Pget_search_string(), subroutineThe get_search_string( ) subroutine asks the user for a
string to search for by calling search_read( ).

Ωcol_search() Pcol_search(), subroutineint col_search(char *str, int col)    /* search.e */≤æ≤
The col_search( ) subroutine defined in search.e attempts to go
to the beginning of the next line containing a certain string
starting in a certain column.  It returns 1 if the search is
successful, 0 otherwise.

Ωline_search()prox_line_search() Pline_search(), subroutine Pprox_line_search(), subroutineint line_search(int dir, char *s)     /* grep.e */≤int prox_line_search(char *s)     /* tags.e */≤æ≤
The line_search( ) subroutine searches in direction dir
for a line containing only the text s.   It returns 1 if
found, otherwise 0.

The prox_line_search( ) subroutine searches in the buffer for
lines containing exactly the text s.  It goes to the start of
the closest such line to point, and returns 1.  If there is no
matching line, it returns 0.

Ωdo_drop_matching_lines() Pdo_drop_matching_lines(), subroutinedo_drop_matching_lines(int flags, char *pat, int drop)≤æ≤
The do_drop_matching_lines( ) subroutine deletes all lines
after point in the current buffer but those that contain the
specified search pattern.  The search flags say how to interpret the
pattern.  If drop is nonzero, the subroutine deletes lines that
contain the pattern; if drop is zero it deletes all lines except
those that contain the pattern.  Temporarily set the sort-status
variable to zero to keep it from displaying a line count summary.

Ωreplace_in_existing_hook()replace_in_readonly_hook() Preplace_in_existing_hook(), subroutine Preplace_in_readonly_hook(), subroutine Pdo_readonly_warning(), subroutinereplace_in_readonly_hook(int old_readonly)≤replace_in_existing_hook(int old_readonly)≤æ≤
The file-query-replace command calls some hook functions as
it goes through its list of buffers or files.  Just before it makes
its first change in each buffer (or asks the user whether to make the
change, if it's still in query mode), it calls either the
replace_in_existing_hook( ) subroutine (if the buffer or
file was already loaded before running the command) or the
replace_in_readonly_hook( ) (if file-query-replace
had to read the file itself).  The file-query-replace command
temporarily zeroes the readonly-warning variable; it passes the
original value of this variable as a parameter to each hook.

The default version of replace_in_existing_hook( ) does nothing.
The default version of replace_in_readonly_hook( ) warns about
the file being read-only by calling do_readonly_warning( ).

The nl_forward( ) and nl_reverse( ) primitives quickly
search for newline characters in the direction you specify.
The nl_forward( ) primitive is the same as search(1, "¥n"), while
nl_reverse( )≈nl_reverse() is the same as search(-1, "¥n"), where
¥n means the newline character (see Rescsequencesπescsequences).  These primitives do not set matchstart
or matchend, but otherwise work the same as the previous
searching primitives, returning 1 if they find a newline and
0 if they don't.

The eel.h file defines textual macros named to_begin_line()
and to_end_line() that make it easy to go to the beginning or
end of the current line.  They simply search in the appropriate
direction for a newline character and back up over it if the search
succeeds.

The give_begin_line( ) subroutine returns the buffer position
of the beginning of the current line, and the give_end_line( )
subroutine returns the position of its end.  Neither moves point.

Ωgo_line()lines_between()all_blanks() Pgo_line(), subroutine Plines_between(), primitive Pall_blanks(), subroutinego_line(int num)            /* basic.e */≤int lines_between(int from, int to, ?int abort_ok)≤int all_blanks(int from, int to)    /* indent.e */≤æ≤
The EEL subroutine go_line( ) defined in basic.e uses the
nl_forward( )≈nl_forward() primitive to go to a certain line in the buffer.
go_line(2), for example, goes to the beginning of the second
line in the buffer.

The lines_between( ) primitive returns the number of newline
characters in the part of the buffer between from and to.
If abort_ok is nonzero, the user can abort from this primitive,
otherwise Epsilon ignores the abort key.

The all_blanks( ) subroutine returns 1 if the characters
between from and to are all whitespace characters (space,
tab, or newline), 0 otherwise.

3Other Movement Functions

 Pmove_level(), subroutinemove_level()Rmove-levelΩint move_level(int dir, char *findch,≤               char *otherch, int show, int stop_on_key)≤buffer int (*mode_move_level)();≤int c_move_level(int dir, int stop_on_key)≤int html_move_level(int dir, int stop_on_key)≤int default_move_level(int dir, char *findch,≤                       char *otherch)≤æ≤
Several subroutines move through text counting and
matching various sorts of delimiters.  The move_level( )
subroutine takes a direction dir which may be 1 or -1,
and two sets of delimiters.  The routine searches for any one of the
characters in findch.  Upon finding one, it continues searching
in the same direction for the character in the same position in
otherch, skipping over matched pairs of these characters in its
search.

For example, if findch was ">])" and dir was
-1, move_level( ) would search backwards for one of these
three characters.  If it found a ")" first, it would then select the
third character of otherch, which might be a "(".  It would then
continue searching for a "(".  But if it found additional ")"
characters before reaching that "(", it would need to find additional
"(" characters before stopping.

The subroutine returns 1 to indicate that it found a match, and
leaves point on the far side of the match (like commands such as
forward-level).  If no match can be found, the subroutine
returns 0.  Additionally, if its parameter show is nonzero,
it displays an "Unmatched delimiter" message.  When no characters
in findch can be found in the specified direction, it sets point
to the far end of the buffer and returns 1.  If stop_on_key
is nonzero, the subroutine will occasionally check for user key
presses, and abort its search if the user has pressed a key.  It
returns -2 in this case and doesn't change point.

mode_move_levelc_move_level() Vmode_move_level, variable Pc_move_level(), subroutineCertain modes define a replacement level matcher that understands
more of the syntax of that mode's language.  They do this by setting
the buffer-specific function pointer variable
mode_move_level to a function such as
c_move_level( ).  The move_level( ) subroutine will
call this function instead of doing its normal processing when this
variable is nonzero in the current buffer.

Any such function will receive only dir and stop_on_key
parameters.  (It should already know which delimiters are significant
in its language.)  It should return the buffer position it reached
(but not actually move there), if it found a pair of matched
delimiters, or if it reached one end of the buffer without finding
any suitable delimiters.  If should return -1 if it detected an
unmatched delimiter, or -2 if a keypress made it abort.

default_move_level()html_move_level() Pdefault_move_level(), subroutine Phtml_move_level(), subroutineThe default_move_level( ) function is what
move_level( ) calls when no mode-specific function is available.
It takes parameters like move_level( ), and returns -1 or a
buffer position like c_move_level( ).  A mode-specific function
may wish to call this function, specifying a set of delimiters
suitable for that language.  The html_move_level( )
subroutine, for example, does just that.

Ωgive_position() Pgive_position(), subroutineint give_position(int (*cmd)())≤æ≤
The give_position( ) subroutine runs the subroutine cmd,
which (typically) moves to a new position in the buffer.  The
give_position( ) subroutine returns this new position, but
restores point to its original value.  For example,
give_position(forward_word) returns the buffer position of the
end of the current word.  EEL requires that cmd be declared
before you call it, via a line like int cmd();, unless it's
defined in the same file, before the give_position( ) call.

3Sorting Primitives

 Pbuffer_sort(), primitivesortingbuffer_sort()Ωdo_buffer_sort() Pdo_buffer_sort(), subroutinebuffer_sort(char *newbuf, ?int col)≤do_buffer_sort(char *newbuf, int col, int rev)≤sort_another(char *buf, int col, int rev)≤do_sort_region(int from, int to, int col, int rev)≤char sort_status;≤æ≤

The EEL primitive buffer_sort( ) sorts the lines
of the current buffer alphabetically.  It does not modify the buffer,
but rather inserts a sorted copy into the named buffer (which must be
different).  It performs each comparison starting at column col,
which is optional and defaults to 0 (the first column).  The sorting
order is determined by the ¬_srch_case_map≈_srch_case_map array (see Rsrchmapπsrchmap).

If the variable sort_status≈sort_status is nonzero, Epsilon will display
progress messages as the sort progresses.  Otherwise, no status
messages appear.

The do_buffer_sort( ) subroutine is similar, but also takes a
parameter rev that says whether to perform a reverse sort.  If
the parameter rev is nonzero, Epsilon performs a reverse sort
(by making a copy of the current _srch_case_map array with an
inverted order).

sort_another() Psort_another(), subroutineThe sort_another( ) subroutine takes the name of a buffer and
sorts it in place.  The parameter col specifies the column to
sort on, and rev, if nonzero, requests a reverse sort.

do_sort_region() Pdo_sort_region(), subroutineThe do_sort_region( ) subroutine sorts a portion of the current
buffer in place.  The from and to parameters specify the
region to sort.  The col parameter specifies the column to sort
on, and the rev parameter, if nonzero, requests a reverse sort.

 PABORT_JUMP, textual macro PABORT_ERROR, textual macroIf the user presses the abort key during sorting, Epsilon's behavior
depends upon the value of the abort_searching≈abort_searching variable.  If
0, the key is ignored and the sort will run to completion.  If
πMABORT_JUMP, Epsilon aborts the sort and jumps by calling the
check_abort( ) primitive.  If πMABORT_ERROR, Epsilon aborts
the sort and returns πMABORT_ERROR.  Whenever Epsilon aborts a
sort, nothing gets inserted in the newbuf buffer. (For the
subroutines that sort in place, the buffer is not changed.)  Except
when aborted, the buffer_sort( ) primitive and all the sorting
subroutines described above return 0.

3Other Formatting Functions

 Pright_align_columns(), subroutineright_align_columns()Ωright_align_columns(char *pat)≤æ≤
The right_align_columns( ) subroutine locates all lines containing a
match for the regular expression pattern pat.  It notes the ending column
of each match.  (It assumes that pat occurs no more than one per line.)

Then, if some matches end at an earlier column than others, it adds
indentation before each match as needed, so all matches will end at the same
column.

3Comparing Primitives

 Pbuffers_identical(), subroutine Pcompare_buffer_text(), primitivebuffers_identical()compare_buffer_text()Ωint compare_buffer_text(int buf1, int pos1,≤                        int buf2, int pos2, int fold)≤int buffers_identical(int a, int b)≤æ≤
The compare_buffer_text( ) primitive compares two buffers,
specified by buffer numbers, starting at the given offsets within
each.  If fold is nonzero, Epsilon performs case-folding as in
searching before comparing each character, using the case-folding
rules of the current buffer.  The primitive returns the number of
characters that matched before the first mismatch.

The buffers_identical( ) subroutine checks to see if two
buffers, specified by their buffer numbers, are identical.  It
returns nonzero if the buffers are identical, zero if they differ.
If neither buffer exists, they're considered identical; if one
exists, they're different.

Ωdo_uniq() Pdo_uniq(), subroutinedo_uniq(int incl_uniq, int incl_dups, int talk)≤æ≤
The do_uniq( ) subroutine defined in uniq.e goes through the
current buffer comparing each line to the next, and deleting each
line unless it meets certain conditions.

If incl_uniq is nonzero, lines that aren't immediately followed
by an identical line will be preserved.  If incl_dups is nonzero,
the first copy of each line that is immediately followed by one or
more identical lines will be preserved.  (The duplicate lines that
follow will always be deleted.)

If talk is nonzero, the subroutine will display status messages
as it proceeds.

Ωdo_compare_sorted() Pdo_compare_sorted(), subroutinedo_compare_sorted(int b1, int b2, char *only1,≤                  char *only2, char *both)≤æ≤
The do_compare_sorted( ) subroutine works like the
compare-sorted-windows command, but lets you specify the two
buffers to compare, and the names of the three result buffers.  Any
of the result buffer names may be NULL, and the subroutine won't
generate data for that buffer.

3Managing Buffers

buffer number Pcreate(), primitivecreate()Ωbufnum_to_name() Pbufnum_to_name(), primitiveint create(char *buf)≤char *bufnum_to_name(int bnum)≤int name_to_bufnum(char *bname)≤int zap(char *buf)≤buf_zap(int bnum)≤int change_buffer_name(char *newname)≤æ≤
The create( ) primitive makes a new buffer.  It takes the name
of the buffer to create.  If the buffer already exists, nothing
happens.  In either case, it returns the buffer number of the buffer.

Some primitives let you specify a buffer by
name; others let you specify a buffer by number.  Epsilon tries never
to reuse buffer numbers, so EEL functions can look a buffer up by its
buffer number to see if a particular buffer still exists.  Functions
that accept a buffer number generally start with buf_.

name_to_bufnum() Pname_to_bufnum(), primitiveUse the bufnum_to_name( ) primitive to convert from a buffer
number to the buffer's name.  If no such buffer exists, it
returns a null pointer.  The name_to_bufnum( ) primitive takes
a buffer name, and gives you the corresponding buffer number.  If no
such buffer exists, it returns zero.

zap()buf_zap() Pzap(), primitive Pbuf_zap(), primitiveThe zap( ) primitive creates a buffer if necessary, but
empties it of all characters if the buffer already exists.  So
calling zap( ) always results in an empty buffer.  The zap( )
primitive returns the buffer number of the buffer, whether or not it
needed to create the buffer.  The buf_zap( ) primitive works
like zap( ), except the former takes a buffer number instead of a
buffer name, and signals an error if no buffer with that number
exists.  Unlike zap( ), buf_zap( ) cannot create a buffer.
Neither primitive switches to the emptied buffer.

change_buffer_name() Pchange_buffer_name(), primitiveThe change_buffer_name( ) primitive renames the current buffer
to the indicated name.  If there is already a buffer with the new
name, the primitive returns 0, otherwise the buffer is renamed
and the primitive returns 1.

Ωexist()buf_exist()delete_buffer()buf_delete() Pexist(), primitive Pbuf_exist(), primitive Pdelete_buffer(), primitive Pbuf_delete(), primitiveint exist(char *buf)≤int buf_exist(int bnum)≤delete_buffer(char *buf)≤delete_user_buffer(char *buf)≤buf_delete(int bnum)≤drop_buffer(char *buf)        /* buffer.e */≤char *temp_buf()        /* basic.e */≤int tmp_buf()       /* basic.e */≤æ≤
The exist( ) primitive tells whether a buffer with a particular
name exists.  It returns 1 if the buffer exists, 0 if not.
The buf_exist( ) does the same thing, but takes a buffer
number instead of a buffer name.

delete_user_buffer() Pdelete_user_buffer(), subroutineThe delete_buffer( ) primitive removes a buffer with a given
name.  It also removes all windows associated with the buffer.  The
buf_delete( ) primitive does the same thing, but takes a buffer
number.  Epsilon signals an error if the buffer does not exist, if it
contains a running process, or if one of the buffer's windows could
not be deleted.  If the buffer might have syntax highlighting in it,
use the delete_user_buffer( ) subroutine instead; it cleans
up some data needed by syntax highlighting.

drop_buffer() Pdrop_buffer(), subroutineThe drop_buffer( ) subroutine deletes the buffer, but queries
the user first like the kill-buffer command if the buffer
contains unsaved changes.

temp_buf()tmp_buf() Ptemp_buf(), subroutine Ptmp_buf(), subroutineThe EEL subroutine temp_buf( ), defined in basic.e, uses the
exist( ) primitive to create an unused name for a temporary
buffer.  It returns the name of the empty buffer it creates.  The
tmp_buf( ) subroutine creates a temporary buffer like
temp_buf( ), but returns its number instead of its name.

Ωbuffer char *bufname;≤buffer int bufnum;≤æ≤
The bufname≈bufname variable returns the name of the current buffer,
and the bufnum≈bufnum variable gives its number.  Setting either
switches to a different buffer.  If the indicated buffer does not
exist, nothing happens.  Use this method of switching buffers only to
temporarily switch to a new buffer; use the to_buffer( ) or
to_buffer_num( ) subroutines described in Rtobufferπtobuffer to change the buffer a window will display.

To set the bufname variable, use the syntax bufname = »new
value…;.  Don't use strcpy( ), for example, to modify it.

The buffer_size( ) and buf_size( ) subroutines
returns the size in characters of the indicated buffer (specified by
its name or number).  The get_buf_point( ) subroutine
returns the value of point in the indicated buffer.  The
set_buf_point( ) subroutine sets point in the specified
buffer to the value pos.  These are all defined in buffer.e.

3Catching Buffer Changes

If the buffer-specific call_on_modify≈call_on_modify variable has a nonzero
value in a particular buffer, whenever any primitive tries to modify
that buffer, Epsilon calls the EEL subroutine on_modify( )
first.  By default, that subroutine calls the
normal_on_modify( ) subroutine, which aborts the
modification if the buffer-specific variable _buf_readonly
is nonzero, indicating a read-only buffer, and does various similar
things.

But if the buffer_on_modify buffer-specific function pointer is
nonzero for that buffer, on_modify( ) instead calls the subroutine it
indicates.  That subroutine may wish to call normal_on_modify( ) itself.

An on_modify( ) function can abort the modification or set
variables.  But if it plans to return, it must not create or delete
buffers, or permanently switch buffers.

One of normal_on_modify( )'s tasks is to handle read-only buffers.
There are several types of these, distinguished by the value of the
_buf_readonly variable, which if nonzero indicates the buffer is
read-only.  A value of 1 means the user explicitly set the buffer
read-only.  The value 2 means Epsilon automatically set the buffer
read-only because its corresponding file was read-only.

A value of 3 indicates pager mode; this is just like a normal
read-only buffer, but if the user action causing the attempt at
buffer modification happens to be the result of the ⁄Space€ or
⁄Backspace€ keys, Epsilon cancels the modification and pages
forward or backward, respectively.

check_modify() Pcheck_modify(), primitiveThe check_modify( ) primitive runs the on_modify( )
function on a specified buffer (if call_on_modify is nonzero in
that buffer).  You can use this if you plan to modify a buffer later
but want any side effects to happen now.  If the buffer is marked
read-only, this function will abort with an error message.  If the
buffer is in virtual mode and its cursor is positioned in virtual
space, Epsilon will insert whitespace characters to reach the virtual
column.  Because this can change the value of point, you should call
check_modify( ) before passing the values of spots to any
function.

For example, suppose you write a subroutine to replace the previous
character with a "+", using a statement like replace(point - 1,
'+');.  Suppose point has the value 10, and appears at the end of a
line containing "abc" (in column 3).  Using virtual mode, the user
might have positioned the cursor to column 50, however.  If you used
the above statement, Epsilon would call replace( ) with the value
9.  Before replacing, Epsilon would call on_modify( ), which, in
virtual mode, would insert tabs and spaces to reach column 50, and
move point to the end of the inserted text.  Then Epsilon would
replace the character "c" at buffer position 9 with "+".  If you call
check_modify(bufnum); first, however, Epsilon inserts its tabs
and spaces to reach column 50, and point - 1 correctly refers to
the last space it inserted.

Ωreset_modified_buffer_region()modified_buffer_region() Preset_modified_buffer_region(), primitive Pmodified_buffer_region(), primitivereset_modified_buffer_region(char *tag)≤int modified_buffer_region(int *from, int *to, ?char *tag)≤æ≤
Sometimes an EEL function needs to know if a buffer has been modified
since the last time it checked.  Epsilon can maintain this
information using tagged buffer modification regions.

An EEL function first tells Epsilon to begin collecting this
information for the current buffer by calling the
reset_modified_buffer_region( ) primitive and passing a
unique tag name.  (Epsilon's syntax highlighting uses a modified
buffer region named needs-color, for instance.)  Later it can
call the modified_buffer_region( ) primitive, passing the
same tag name.  Epsilon will set its from and to parameters
to indicate the range of the buffer that has been modified since the
first call.

For example, say a buffer contains six characters abcdef when
reset_modified_buffer_region( ) is called.  Then the user inserts
and deletes some characters resulting in abxyf.  A
modified_buffer_region( ) would now report that characters in the
range 2 to 4 have been changed.  If the buffer contains many disjoint
changes, from will indicate the start of the first change, and
to the end of the last.

The modified_buffer_region( ) primitive returns 0 if the
buffer hasn't been modified since the last
reset_modified_buffer_region( ) with that tag.  In this case
from and to will be equal.  (They might also be equal if only
deletion of text had occurred, but then the primitive wouldn't have
returned 0.)  It returns 1 if the buffer has been modified.
If reset_modified_buffer_region( ) has never been used with the
specified tag in the current buffer, it returns -1, and sets the
from and to variables to indicate the whole buffer.

The tag may be omitted when calling
modified_buffer_region( ).  In that case Epsilon uses an internal
tag that's reset on each buffer display.  So the primitive indicates
which part of the current buffer has been modified since the last
buffer display.

3Listing Buffers

 Pbuf_list(), primitive Pbuffer_list(), primitivebuf_list()buffer_list()Ωchar *buffer_list(int start)≤int buf_list(int offset, int mode)≤æ≤
The buffer_list( ) primitive gets the name of each
buffer in turn.  Each time you call this primitive, it returns the name of
another buffer.  It begins again when given a nonzero argument.
When it has returned the names of all the buffers since the last call
with a nonzero argument, it returns a null pointer.

The buf_list( ) primitive can return the number of each
existing buffer, one at a time, like buffer_list( ).  The
mode can be 0, 1, or 2, to position to the
lowest-numbered buffer in the list, the last buffer returned by
buf_list( ), or the highest-numbered buffer, respectively.  The
offset lets you advance from these buffers to lower or
higher-numbered buffers, by providing a negative or positive offset.
Unlike buffer_list( ), this primitive lets you back up or go
through the list backwards.

For example, this code fragment displays the names of all buffers,
one at a time, once forward and once backward:

Ωs = buffer_list(1);≤do {≤        say("Forward ≥d: ≥s", name_to_bufnum(s), s);≤} while (s = buffer_list(0));≤≤i = buf_list(0, 2);≤do {≤        say("Back ≥d: ≥s", i, bufnum_to_name(i));≤} while (i = buf_list(-1, 1));≤say("Done.");≤æ≤

 Premove_window(), primitive Pwindow_one(), primitive Pwindow_kill(), primitiveremove_window()window_one()window_kill()Ωwindow_kill()≤window_one()≤æ≤
The window_kill( ) primitive removes the current window if
possible, in the same way as the kill-window command does.
The window_one( ) primitive eliminates all but the current
window, as the command one-window does.

Ωremove_window(int win)≤æ≤
The remove_window( ) primitive deletes a window by handle or
number.  If you delete a tiled window, Epsilon expands other windows
as needed to fill its space.  You cannot delete the last remaining
tiled window.

Ωgive_window_space() Pgive_window_space(), primitiveint give_window_space(int dir)≤#define BLEFT   0   /* direction codes */≤#define BTOP    1≤#define BRIGHT  2≤#define BBOTTOM 3≤æ≤
The give_window_space( ) primitive deletes the current window.
It expands adjacent windows in the specified direction into the newly
available space, returning 0.  If there are no windows in the
specified direction, it does nothing and returns 1.

Ωwindow_split()MHORIZONTALMVERTICAL Pwindow_split(), primitive PHORIZONTAL, textual macro PVERTICAL, textual macrowindow_split(int orientation)≤#define HORIZONTAL      (0)≤#define VERTICAL        (1)≤æ≤
The window_split( ) primitive makes two windows from the
current window, like the commands split-window and
split-window-vertically do.  The argument to
window_split( ) tells whether to make the new windows appear one
on top of the other (with argument HORIZONTAL) or side-by-side
(with argument VERTICAL).  The standard EEL header file,
eel.h, defines the macros HORIZONTAL and VERTICAL.  The
primitive returns zero if it could not split the window, otherwise
nonzero.  When you split the window, Epsilon automatically remembers
to call the prepare_windows( ) and build_mode( )
subroutines during the next redisplay.

Ωwindow handlewindow numberuser short window_handle;≤user short window_number;≤next_user_window(int dir)≤æ≤
You may refer to a window in two ways: by its ªwindow handleº or
by its ªwindow numberº.

Epsilon assigns a unique window handle to a window when it creates
the window.  This window handle stays with the window for the
duration of that window's lifetime.  To get the window handle
of the current window, use the window_handle≈window_handle primitive.

The window number, on the other hand, denotes the window's current
position in the window order.  You can think of the window order as
the position of a window in a list of windows.  Initially the list
has only one window.  When you split a window, the two child windows
replace it in the list.  The top or left window comes before the
bottom or right window.  When you delete a window, that window leaves
the list.  The window in the upper left has window number 0.
Pop-up windows always come after tiled windows in this order, with
the most recently created (and therefore topmost) pop-up window last.
The window_number≈window_number primitive gives the window number of the
current window.

Epsilon treats windows in a dialog much like pop-up windows,
assigning each a window number and window handle.  The stacking order
of dialogs is independent of their window handles, however.  Deleting
all the windows on a dialog makes Epsilon remove the dialog.
(Epsilon doesn't count windows with the system_window flag set
when determining if you've deleted the last window.)

To change to a different window, you can set either the
window_handle or window_number variables.  Epsilon then
makes the indicated window become the current window.  Epsilon
interprets window_number modulo the number
of windows, so window number -1 refers to the last window.

Many primitives that require you to specify a window will accept
either its handle or its number.  Use window_handle to remember
a particular window, since its number can change as you add or delete
windows.

next_user_window() Pnext_user_window(), subroutineYou can increment or decrement the window_number variable to
cycle through the list of available windows.  But it's usually better
to use the next_user_window( ) subroutine, passing it 1
to go to the next window or -1 to go to the previous one.  This
will skip over system windows.

Ωnumber_of_windows()number_of_popups()number_of_user_windows()is_window()MISTILEDMISPOPUP Pnumber_of_windows(), primitive Pnumber_of_popups(), primitive Pnumber_of_user_windows(), subroutine Pis_window(), primitive PISTILED, textual macro PISPOPUP, textual macroint number_of_windows()≤int number_of_popups()≤int number_of_user_windows()≤int is_window(int win)≤#define ISTILED         1≤#define ISPOPUP         2≤æ≤
The number_of_windows( ) primitive returns the total number of
windows, and the number_of_popups( ) primitive returns the number
of pop-up windows.  The number_of_user_windows( ) subroutine
returns the total number of windows, excluding system windows.

The is_window( ) primitive accepts a window handle or window
number.  It returns ISTILED if the value refers to a
conventional tiled window, ISPOPUP if the value refers to a
pop-up window or a window in a dialog, or 0 if the value does not
refer to a window.

3Window Resizing Primitives

 Ptext_width(), primitive Ptext_height(), primitivetext_width()text_height()Ωuser window short window_height;≤user window short window_width;≤int text_height()≤int text_width()≤æ≤
The window_height≈window_height variable contains the height of the current
window in lines, including any mode line or borders.  Setting it
changes the size of the window.  Each window must have at least one
line of height.  The window_width≈window_width variable contains the width
of the current window, counting any borders the window may have.
If you set these variables to illegal values, Epsilon will adjust
them to the closest legal values.

The text_height( ) and text_width( ) primitives, on the
other hand, exclude borders and mode lines from their calculations,
returning only the number of lines or columns of the window available
for the display of text.

Ωwindow_edge()MTOPLEFTMBOTTOMRIGHT Pwindow_edge(), primitive PTOPLEFT, textual macro PBOTTOMRIGHT, textual macroint window_edge(int orien, int botright)≤#define TOPLEFT         (0)≤#define BOTTOMRIGHT     (1)≤æ≤
The window_edge( ) primitive tells you where on the screen the
current window appears.  For the first parameter, specify either
πMHORIZONTAL or πMVERTICAL, to get the column or row,
respectively.  For the second parameter, provide either
TOPLEFT or BOTTOMRIGHT, to specify the corner.
Counting starts at the upper left corner of the screen, which has
0 for both coordinates.

3Preserving Window Arrangements

Ωstruct window_info {≤        short left, top, right, bottom;≤        short textcolor, hbordcolor;≤        short vbordcolor, titlecolor;≤        short borders, other, bufnum;≤        int point, dpoint;≤        /* primitives fill in before this line */≤        int dcolumn;≤        short prevbuf;≤};≤≤get_window_info(int win, struct window_info *p)≤low_window_info(int win, struct window_info *p)≤window_create(int first, struct window_info *p)≤low_window_create(int first, struct window_info *p)≤select_low_window(int wnum, int top, int bot,≤                  int lines, int cols)≤æ≤
Epsilon has several primitives that are useful for recording a
particular window configuration and reconstructing it later.

get_window_info()low_window_info() Pget_window_info(), subroutine Plow_window_info(), primitiveThe get_window_info( ) subroutine fills a structure with
information on the specified window.  The information includes the
window's size and position, its selected colors, and so forth.  It
uses the low_window_info( ) primitive to collect some of the
information, then fills in the rest itself by inspecting the window.

window_create()low_window_create() Pwindow_create(), subroutine Plow_window_create(), primitiveAfter calling get_window_info( ) on each tiled window (obtaining
a series of structures, each holding information on one window), you
can restore that window configuration using the
window_create( ) subroutine.  It takes a pointer to a structure
that get_window_info( ) filled in, and a flag that must be
nonzero if this is the first window in the new configuration.  It
uses the low_window_create( ) primitive to create the window.
The point or dpoint members of the structure may be -1
when you call window_create( ) or low_window_create( ), and
Epsilon will provide default values for point and
window_start in the new window, based on values stored with the
buffer.  The window-creating functions remain in the window they
create, so you can modify its window-specific variables.

select_low_window() Pselect_low_window(), primitiveAfter a series of window_create( )'s, you must use the
select_low_window( ) primitive to switch to one of the created
windows (specifying it by window number or handle, as usual).

Using window_create( ) directly modifies windows, and Epsilon
doesn't check that the resulting window configuration is legal.  For
example, you can define a set of tiled windows that leave gaps on the
screen, overlap, or extend past the screen borders.  The result of
creating an illegal window configuration is undefined.

The first time you call window_create( ), pass it a nonzero
flag, and Epsilon will (internally) delete all tiled windows, and
create the first window.  Then call window_create( ) again, as
needed, to create the remaining windows (pass it a zero flag).
Finally, you must call the select_low_window( ) primitive.  Once
you begin using window_create( ), Epsilon will not be able to
refresh the screen correctly until you call the
select_low_window( ) primitive to exit window-creation.  The
top and bot parameters specify the new values of the
¬avoid-top-lines≈avoid-top-lines and ¬avoid-bottom-lines≈avoid-bottom-lines variables, and
set the variables to the indicated values while finishing window
creation.  The lines and cols parameters specify the size of
the screen that was used to construct the old window configuration.
All windows defined using low_window_create( ) are based on that
screen size.  When you call select_low_window( ), Epsilon resizes
all the windows you've defined so that they fit the current screen
size.

Ωsave_screen()restore_screen() Psave_screen(), subroutine Prestore_screen(), subroutinesave_screen(struct screen_info *p)≤restore_screen(struct screen_info *p)≤æ≤
The save_screen( ) subroutine saves Epsilon's window
configuration in a struct screen_info structure.  The first time
you call this subroutine on an instance of the screen_info
structure, make sure its wins member is zero.  The
restore_screen( ) subroutine restores Epsilon's window
configuration from such a structure.

3Pop-up Windows

Ωadd_popup() Padd_popup(), primitiveint add_popup(column, row, width, height, border, bnum)≤   /* macros for defining a window's borders */≤   /* BORD(BTOP, BSINGLE) puts single line on top */≤#define BLEFT   0≤#define BTOP    1≤#define BRIGHT  2≤#define BBOTTOM 3≤#define BNONE   0≤#define BBLANK  1≤#define BSINGLE 2≤#define BDOUBLE 3≤#define BORD(side, val)         (((val) & 3) << ((side) * 2))≤#define GET_BORD(side, bord)     ((bord >> (side * 2)) & 3)≤#define LR_BORD(val)    (BORD(BLEFT, (val)) + BORD(BRIGHT, (val)))≤#define TB_BORD(val)    (BORD(BTOP, (val)) + BORD(BBOTTOM, (val)))≤#define ALL_BORD(val)   (LR_BORD(val) + TB_BORD(val))≤æ≤
The add_popup( ) primitive creates a new pop-up window.  It
accepts the column and row of the upper left corner of the
new window, and the width and height of the window (including
any borders).  The border parameter contains a code saying what
sort of borders the window should have, and the bnum parameter
gives the buffer number of the buffer to display in the window.  The
primitive returns the handle of the new window, or -1 if the
specified buffer did not exist, so Epsilon couldn't create the
window.  If the pop-up window is to become part of a dialog (see Rdisplaydialogboxπdisplay-dialog-box), its size, position and border will be
determined by the dialog, not the values passed to add_popup( ).

MBNONEMBBLANKMBSINGLEMBDOUBLEMBLEFTMBTOPMBRIGHTMBBOTTOMMBORD() PBNONE, textual macro PBBLANK, textual macro PBSINGLE, textual macro PBDOUBLE, textual macro PBLEFT, textual macro PBTOP, textual macro PBRIGHT, textual macro PBBOTTOM, textual macro PBORD(), textual macroYou can define the borders of a window using macros from codes.h.
For each of the four sides, you can specify no border, a blank
border, a border drawn with a single line, or a border drawn with a
double line, using the codes BNONE, BBLANK,
BSINGLE, or BDOUBLE, respectively.  Specify the
side to receive the border with the macros BLEFT,
BTOP, BRIGHT, and BBOTTOM.  You can
make a specification for a given side using the BORD()
macro, writing BORD(BBOTTOM, BDOUBLE) to put a double-line border
at the bottom of the window.  Add the specifications for each side to
get the complete border code.

 PLR_BORD(), textual macro PTB_BORD(), textual macroYou can use other macros to simplify the border specification.  Write
LR_BORD(BSINGLE) + TB_BORD(BDOUBLE) to produce a window with
single-line borders on the left and right, and double-line borders
above and below.  Write ALL_BORD(BNONE) for a window with no
borders at all, and the most room for
text.

 PALL_BORD(), textual macroMGET_BORD() PGET_BORD(), textual macroYou can use the GET_BORD() macro to extract (from a complete
border code) the specification for one of its sides.  For example, to
find the border code for the left-side border of a window with a
border value of bval, write GET_BORD(BLEFT, bval).  If the
window has a double-line border on that side, the macro would yield
BDOUBLE.

Ωwindow_at_coords() Pwindow_at_coords(), primitiveint window_at_coords(int row, int col, ?int screen)≤æ≤
The window_at_coords( ) primitive provides the handle of the
topmost window at a given set of screen coordinates.  The primitive
returns -1 if no window occupies that part of the screen.  The
screen number parameter can be zero or omitted to refer to the main
screen, but it is usually a screen number from the
mouse_screen≈mouse_screen primitive.

Ωwindow_to_screen() Pwindow_to_screen(), primitiveint window_to_screen(int win)≤æ≤
The window_to_screen( ) primitive takes a window handle and
returns its screen number.  Windows that are part of a dialog box
have nonzero screen numbers; in this version other windows always
have a screen number of zero.

Ωscreen_to_window() Pscreen_to_window(), primitiveint screen_to_window(int screen)≤æ≤
The screen_to_window( ) primitive takes a screen number, as
returned in the variable mouse_screen, and returns the window
handle associated with it.  If the screen number is zero, there may
be several windows associated with it; Epsilon will choose the first
one.  In this version of Epsilon, nonzero screen numbers uniquely
specify a window.

Ωuser window int window_left;≤user window int window_top;≤æ≤
The window_left≈window_left and window_top≈window_top primitive variables
provide screen coordinates for the current window.  You can set the
coordinates of a pop-up window to move the window around.  Epsilon
ignores attempts to set these variables in tiled windows.

3Pop-up Window Subroutines

 Pview_buf(), subroutine Pview_buffer(), subroutineview_buf()view_buffer()Ωview_buffer(char *buf, int last)   /* complete.e */≤view_buf(int buf, int last)      /* complete.e */≤æ≤
Several commands in Epsilon display information using the
view_buffer( ) subroutine.  It takes the name of a buffer and
displays it page by page in a pop-up window.  The view_buf( )
subroutine takes a buffer number and does the same.  Both take a
parameter last which says whether the command is displaying the
buffer as its last action.

If last is nonzero, Epsilon will create the window and then
return.  Epsilon's main command loop will take care of displaying the
pop-up window, scrolling through it, and removing it when the user's
done examining it.  If the user executes a command like
find-file while the pop-up window is still on the screen,
Epsilon will remove the pop-up and continue with the command.

If last is zero, the viewing subroutine will not return until the
user has removed the pop-up window (by pressing ⁄Space€ or
Ctrl-G, for example).  The command can then continue with its
processing.  The user won't be able to execute a prompting command
like find-file while the pop-up window is still on the screen.

ΩRview-linkedview_linked_buf() Pview_linked_buf(), subroutineview_linked_buf(int buf, int last, int (*linker)())≤int linker(char *link)  /* linker function prototype */≤æ≤
Epsilon uses a variation of view_buf( ) to
display some online help.  The variation adds support for simple
hyperlinks.  The user can select one of the links in a page of
displayed text and follow it to go to another page, or potentially to
perform any other action.  The view_linked_buf( ) subroutine
shows a buffer with links.

The links are delimited with a Ctrl-A character before and a Ctrl-B
character after each link.  Epsilon's non-Windows documentation file
edoc is in this format.  (See Redocformatπedoc-format.)  The
view_linked_buf( ) subroutine will modify the buffer it
receives, removing and highlighting the links before displaying it.

When the user follows a link, Epsilon will call the function pointer
linker passed as a parameter to view_linked_buf( ).  The
linker function, which may have any name, will receive the link
text as a parameter.

Ω    _view_title_view_border_view_left_view_top_view_right_view_bottom V_view_title, variable V_view_border, variable V_view_left, variable V_view_top, variable V_view_right, variable V_view_bottom, variable/* space at sides of viewed popup */≤short _view_left = 2;≤short _view_top = 2;≤short _view_right = 2;≤short _view_bottom = 6;≤≤short _view_border = ALL_BORD(BSINGLE);≤char *_view_title;      /* title for viewed popup */≤int view_loop(int win)≤æ≤
By default, the above subroutines create a pop-up window with no
title and a single-line border, almost filling the screen.  The
window begins two columns from the left border and stops two columns
from the right, and extends two lines from the top of the screen to
six lines from the bottom.  You can alter any of these values by
setting the variables _view_title, _view_border,
_view_left, _view_top, _view_right, and
_view_bottom.  Preserve the original default value using the
save_var keyword.  For example, this code fragment shows a
buffer in a narrow window near the right edge of the screen labeled
"Results" (surrounding a title with spaces often makes it more
attractive):

Ωview_loop() Pview_loop(), subroutinesave_var _view_left = 40;≤save_var _view_title = " Results ";≤save_var _view_border = ALL_BORD(BDOUBLE);≤view_buffer(buf, 1);≤æ≤
A command that displays a pop-up window may want more control over
the creation and destruction of the pop-up window than
view_buf( ) and similar subroutines provide.  A command can
instead create its pop-up window itself, and call
view_loop( ) to handle user interaction.  The
view_loop( ) subroutine takes the handle of the pop-up window to
work with.  The pop-up window may be a part of a dialog.  (See the
display_dialog_box( ) primitive described in Rdisplaydialogboxπdisplay-dialog-box.)

The view_loop( ) subroutine lets the user scroll around in the
window and watches for an unrecognized key (an alphabetic key, for
example) or a key that has a special meaning.  It returns when the
user presses one of these keys or when the user says to exit.  By
default, the user can scroll off either end of the buffer and this
subroutine will return.  Set the ¬paging-retains-view≈paging-retains-view variable
nonzero to prevent this.  The view_loop( ) subroutine returns an
INP_ code from eel.h to indicate which user action made it exit.
See that file for more information.  The function that called
view_loop( ) may choose to call view_loop( ) again, or to
destroy the pop-up window and continue.

Ωerror_if_input()remove_final_view() Perror_if_input(), subroutine Premove_final_view(), subroutineerror_if_input(int abort) /* complete.e */≤remove_final_view() /* complete.e */≤æ≤
If the user is entering a response to some prompt and gives another
command that also requires a response, Epsilon aborts the command to
prevent confusion.  Such commands should call error_if_input( ),
which will abort if necessary.  The subroutine also removes a viewed
buffer, as described above, by calling remove_final_view( ) if
necessary.  If its abort parameter is nonzero, it will attempt
to abort the outer command as well, if aborting proves necessary.

examine and modify many of a window's attributes, such as its
position, size, or color.  The win parameter contains the handle
or number of the window to modify, and the code parameter
specifies a particular attribute.

πMBTOP, πMBRIGHT, or πMBBOTTOM, to examine or change the
window's size or position.  They refer to the screen coordinate of
the corresponding edge.  You can use PBORDERS to specify a new
border code (see the description of add_popup( ) above).  Or you
can set one of the window's colors: each window has a particular
color class it uses for its normal text (outside of any highlighted
regions), its horizontal borders, its vertical borders, and its title
text.  Use the macros PTEXTCOLOR, PHORIZBORDCOLOR,
PVERTBORDCOLOR, and PTITLECOLOR, respectively, to refer
to these.  Set them using a color class expression.  (See Rcolclassπcolclass.)  For example, the statement

Ωset_wattrib(win, PTEXTCOLOR, color_class viewed_text);≤æ≤
makes the text in window win appear in the color the
user selected for viewed text.

Ωwindow char system_window;≤window char invisible_window;≤æ≤
Setting the window-specific primitive variable system_window≈system_window
to a nonzero value designates the current window as a system window.
The user commands that switch windows will skip over system windows.
Setting the window-specific primitive variable
invisible_window≈invisible_window to a nonzero value makes a window whose text
Epsilon won't display (although it will display the border, if the
window has one).  Epsilon won't modify the part of the screen that
would ordinarily display the window's text.

3Buffer Text in Windows

 Pto_buffer_num(), subroutine Pto_buffer(), subroutineto_buffer_num()Rtobufferto_buffer()Ωto_buffer(char *buf)          /* buffer.e */≤to_buffer_num(int bnum)     /* buffer.e */≤window short window_bufnum;≤switch_to_buffer(int bnum)≤int give_prev_buf()         /* buffer.e */≤to_another_buffer(char *buf)≤tiled_only()            /* window.e */≤int in_bufed()              /* bufed.e */≤quit_bufed()            /* bufed.e */≤æ≤
The to_buffer( ) subroutine defined in
buffer.e connects the current window to the named buffer, while
to_buffer_num( ) does the same, but takes a buffer number.
Both work by setting the window_bufnum≈window_bufnum variable, first
remembering the previous buffer displayed in the window so the user
can easily return to it.  The window_bufnum variable stores the
buffer number of the buffer displayed in the current window.

switch_to_buffer() Pswitch_to_buffer(), subroutineBoth of these functions check the file date of the new buffer and
warn the user if the buffer's file has been modified on disk.  The
switch_to_buffer( ) subroutine skips this checking.

give_prev_buf() Pgive_prev_buf(), subroutineThe give_prev_buf( ) subroutine retrieves the saved buffer
number of the previous buffer displayed in the current window.  If
the previous buffer has been deleted, or there is no previous buffer
for this window, it returns the number of another recently-used
buffer.  If it can't find any suitable buffer, it returns 0.

to_another_buffer() Pto_another_buffer(), subroutineThe to_another_buffer( ) subroutine makes sure that buf is not
the current buffer.  If it is, the subroutine switches the current window to
a different buffer.  This subroutine is useful when you're about to delete a
buffer.

tiled_only()quit_bufed()in_bufed() Ptiled_only(), subroutine Pquit_bufed(), subroutine Pin_bufed(), subroutineSometimes the user may issue a command that switches buffers, while
in a bufed pop-up window, or some other type of pop-up window.
Issuing to_buffer( ) would switch the pop-up window to the new
buffer, rather than the underlying window.  Such commands should call
the tiled_only( ) subroutine before switching buffers.  This
subroutine removes any bufed windows or other unwanted windows, and
returns to the original tiled window.  It calls the
quit_bufed( ) subroutine to remove bufed windows.  If it can't
remove some pop-up windows, it tries to abort the command that
created them.  The quit_bufed( ) subroutine uses the
in_bufed( ) subroutine to determine if the current window is a
bufed window.

Ωfix_window_start() Pfix_window_start(), subroutineuser window int window_start;≤user window int window_end;≤fix_window_start()      /* window.e */≤æ≤
The window_start≈window_start variable provides the buffer position of the
first character displayed in the current window.  Epsilon's redisplay
sets this variable, but you can also set it manually to change what
part of the buffer appears in the window.  When Epsilon updates the
window after a command, it makes sure that point is still somewhere
on the screen, using the new value for window_start.  If not, it
alters window_start so point is visible.

The window_end≈window_end variable provides the buffer position of the last
character displayed in the window.  Epsilon's redisplay
sets this variable.  Setting it does nothing.

The fix_window_start( ) subroutine adjusts window_start,
if necessary, so that it occurs at the beginning of a line.

Ωget_window_pos() Pget_window_pos(), primitiveint get_window_pos(int pos, int *row, int *col)≤int window_line_to_position(int row)≤æ≤
The get_window_pos( ) function takes a buffer position and
finds the window row and column that displays the character at that
position.  It puts the row and column in the locations that row
and col point to.  It returns 0 if it could find the
position in the window, or a code saying why it could not.

A return value of 1 means that the position you gave doesn't
appear in the window because it precedes the first position displayed
in the window.  If the given position doesn't appear in the window
because it follows the last position displayed in the window, the
function returns 2.  A return value of 3 means that the
position "appears" before the left edge of the screen (due to
horizontal scrolling), and 4 means that the position "appears"
too far to the right.  It doesn't change the locations that row
and col refer to when it returns 1 or 2.

window_line_to_position() Pwindow_line_to_position(), primitiveThe window_line_to_position( ) primitive takes the number of
a row in the current window, and returns the buffer position of the
first character displayed on that row.  It returns -1 if the row
number provided is negative or greater than the number of rows in the
window.

Ωuser int line_in_window;≤user int column_in_window;≤æ≤
The line_in_window≈line_in_window and column_in_window≈column_in_window primitives give
you the position of point in the current window, as set by the last
refresh( ).  Both variables start counting from 0.  If you
switch windows, Epsilon will not update these variables until
the next refresh( ).

Ωwindow_extra_lines()build_window() Pwindow_extra_lines(), primitive Pbuild_window(), primitiveint window_extra_lines()≤build_window()≤window_to_fit(int max)      /* window.e */≤popup_near_window(int new, int old)≤æ≤
When buffer text doesn't reach to the bottom of a window, Epsilon
blanks the rest of the window.  The window_extra_lines( )
primitive gives the number of blank lines at the bottom of the window
that don't correspond to any lines in the buffer.

Some of the functions that return information about the text
displayed in a window only provide information as of the last
redisplay.  Due to buffer changes, their information may now be
outdated.  The build_window( ) primitive reconstructs the
current window internally, updating Epsilon's idea of which lines of
text go where in the window, how much will fit, and so forth.  This
primitive updates the value of window_end.  It may also modify
the display_column and window_start variables if displaying
the window as they indicate doesn't get to point.  The
build_window( )≈build_window() function also updates the values returned by
the window_line_to_position(), get_window_pos( ), and
window_extra_lines( ) functions.

window_to_fit() Pwindow_to_fit(), subroutineUse the window_to_fit( ) subroutine to ensure that a pop-up
window is no taller than it needs to be.  It sets the window's height
so that it's just big enough to hold the buffer's text, but never
more than max lines tall.  The subroutine has no effect on
windows that form part of a dialog.

popup_near_window() Ppopup_near_window(), subroutineThe popup_near_window( ) subroutine tries to move a pop-up
window on the screen so it's near another window.  It also adjusts
the height of the pop-up window based on its contents, by calling
window_to_fit( ).  The bufed command uses this to
position its pop-up buffer list near the tiled window from which you
invoked it.

Ωwindow_scroll() Pwindow_scroll(), primitivewindow_scroll(int lines)≤æ≤
The window_scroll( ) primitive scrolls the text of the current
window up or down.  It takes an argument saying how many lines up to
scroll the current window.  With a negative argument, this primitive scrolls
the window down.  (See Rdisplaycolumnπdisplaycolumn for information
on scrolling text left or right.)

3Window Titles and Mode Lines

 Pwindow_title(), primitivetitle, of windowwindow titlewindow_title()ΩMTITLELEFT()MTITLECENTERMTITLERIGHT() PTITLELEFT(), textual macro PTITLECENTER, textual macro PTITLERIGHT(), textual macrowindow_title(int win, int edge, int pos, char *title)≤#define TITLECENTER             (0)≤#define TITLELEFT(offset)       (1 + (offset))≤#define TITLERIGHT(offset)      (-(1 + (offset)))≤make_title(char *result, char *title, int room)≤æ≤
You can position a title
on the top or bottom border of a window using the
window_title( ) primitive.  (Also see the
set_window_caption( ) primitive described in Rsetwindowcaptionπsetwindowcaption.)  It takes the window number in win
and the text to display in title.  (It makes a copy of the text,
so you don't need to make sure it stays around after your function
returns.)  The edge parameter must have the value of πMBTOP
or πMBBOTTOM, depending on whether you want the title displayed
on the top or bottom border of the window.

Construct the pos parameter using one of the macros
TITLELEFT(), TITLECENTER, or
TITLERIGHT().  The TITLECENTER macro centers the
title in the window.  The other two take a number which says how many
characters away from the given border the title should appear.  For
example, TITLERIGHT(3) puts the title three characters away from
the right-hand edge of the window.

Epsilon interprets the percent character "%" specially
when it appears in the title of a window.  Follow the percent
character with a character from the following list, and Epsilon will
substitute the indicated value for that sequence:
Œ%c Epsilon substitutes the current column number, counting
columns from 0.

Œ%C Epsilon substitutes the current column number, counting
columns from 1.

Œ%d Epsilon substitutes the current display column, with a
< before it, and a space after.  However, if the display column
has a value of 0 (meaning horizontal scrolling is enabled, but
the window has not been scrolled), or -1 (meaning the window
wraps long lines), Epsilon substitutes nothing.

Œ%D Epsilon substitutes the current display column, but if the
display column is -1, Epsilon substitutes nothing.

Œ%l Epsilon substitutes the current line number.

Œ%m Epsilon substitutes the text " More ", but only if
characters exist past the end of the window.  If the last
character in the buffer appears in the window, Epsilon substitutes
nothing.

Œ%P Epsilon substitutes the percentage of point through the
buffer, followed by a percent sign.

Œ%p Epsilon substitutes the percentage of point through the
buffer, followed by a percent sign.  However, if the bottom of the
buffer appears in the window, Epsilon displays Bot instead.  Epsilon
displays Top if the top of the buffer appears, and All if the entire
buffer is visible.

Œ%s Epsilon substitutes "* " if the buffer's modified
flag has a nonzero value, otherwise nothing.

Œ%S Epsilon substitutes "*" if the buffer's modified
flag has a nonzero value, otherwise nothing.

Œ%h Epsilon substitutes the current hour in the range 1 to 12.

Œ%H Epsilon substitutes the current hour in military time in the
range 0 to 23.

Œ%n Epsilon substitutes the current minute in the range 0 to 59.

Œ%e Epsilon substitutes the current second in the range 0 to 59.

Œ%a Epsilon substitutes "am" or "pm" as appropriate.

ŒNote: For the current time, use a sequence like
%2h:%02n %a for "3:45 pm" or %02H:%02n:%02e for "15:45:21".

Œ%% Epsilon substitutes a literal "%" character.

Œ%< Indicates that redisplay may omit text to the left,
if all of the information will not fit.

Œ%> Puts any following text as far to the right as possible.


With any of the numeric sequences, you can include a printf-style
field width specifier between the % and the letter.  You can use
the same kinds of field width specifiers as C's printf()
function.  In column 9, for example, the sequence %4c
expands to "   9", %04c expands to "0009",
and %-4c expands to "9   ".

make_title() Pmake_title(), primitiveYou can expand title text in the same way as displaying it would,
using the make_title( ) primitive.  It takes the title to
expand, a character array where it will put the resulting text, and
a width in which the title must fit.  It returns the actual length of
the expanded text.

Ωprepare_windows()build_mode() Pprepare_windows(), subroutine Pbuild_mode(), subroutineprepare_windows()       /* disp.e */≤window char _window_flags;≤#define FORCE_MODE_LINE 1≤#define NO_MODE_LINE    2≤#define WANT_MODE_LINE  4≤≤build_mode()            /* disp.e */≤assemble_mode_line(char *line) /* disp.e */≤set_mode(char *mode)          /* disp.e */≤buffer char *major_mode; /* EEL variable */≤user char mode_start[30];≤user char mode_end[30];≤æ≤
Whenever Epsilon thinks a window's mode line or title may be out of
date, it arranges to call the prepare_windows( ) and
build_mode( ) subroutines during the next redisplay.  The
prepare_windows( ) subroutine arranges for the correct sort of
borders on each window.  This sometimes depends on the presence of
other windows.  For example, tiled windows get a right-hand border
only if there's another window to their right.  This subroutine will
be called before text is displayed.

_window_flagsMFORCE_MODE_LINEMNO_MODE_LINEMWANT_MODE_LINE V_window_flags, window-specific variable PFORCE_MODE_LINE, textual macro PNO_MODE_LINE, textual macro PWANT_MODE_LINE, textual macroBy default, prepare_windows( ) puts a mode line on all tiled
windows, but not on any pop-up windows.  You can set flags in the
window-specific _window_flags variable to change this.  Set
FORCE_MODE_LINE if you want to put a mode line on a pop-up
window, or set NO_MODE_LINE to suppress a tiled window's mode
line.  The prepare_windows( ) subroutine interprets these flags,
and alters the WANT_MODE_LINE flag to tell build_mode( )
whether or not to put a mode line on the window.

mode lineassemble_mode_line() Passemble_mode_line(), subroutineThe build_mode( ) subroutine calls the
assemble_mode_line( ) subroutine to construct a mode line, and
then uses the window_title( ) primitive to install it.

set_mode() Pset_mode(), subroutineThe assemble_mode_line( ) subroutine calls the set_mode( )
subroutine to construct the part of the mode line between square
brackets (the name of the current major mode and a list of minor
modes).

While many changes to the mode line require a knowledge of EEL, you
can do some simple customizations by setting the variables
¬mode_start≈mode_start and ¬mode_end≈mode_end.  These specify the part of the
mode line before the buffer or file name (by default, just a space),
and the part of the mode line after the square brackets (by default,
an optional display column, a buffer percentage, a space, and an
optional modification star).  Edit these variables with
set-variable, using the percent character sequences listed
above.  For example, if you wanted each mode line to start with a
line and column number, you could set mode_start to
" Line %l Col %c ".

set_mode_message() Pset_mode_message(), subroutineAn EEL function can add text to the start of a particular buffer's
mode line by setting the buffer-specific variable ¬mode_extra≈mode_extra.
Call the set_mode_message( ) subroutine to do this.  It
takes a pointer to the new text, or NULL to remove the current
buffer's extra text.  Internet FTP's use this to display the percent
of a file that's been received (and similar data).

The set_mode( ) subroutine gets the name of the major
mode from the buffer-specific ¬major_mode≈major_mode variable, and adds
the names of minor modes itself.  You can add new minor modes by
replacing this function (see Rmultipleπmultiple).

Ωdisplay_more_msg() Pdisplay_more_msg(), subroutinedisplay_more_msg(int win)≤æ≤
The display_more_msg( ) subroutine makes the bottom border of
the window win display a "More" message when there are
characters past the end of the window, by defining a window title
that uses the %m sequence.

3Normal Buffer Display

 Pmaybe_refresh(), primitive Prefresh(), primitivemaybe_refresh()refresh()Epsilon provides many primitives for altering the screen contents.
This section describes those relating to the automatic display of
buffers that happens after each command, as described below.

Ωrefresh()≤maybe_refresh()≤æ≤
The refresh( ) primitive does a standard screen refresh,
showing the contents of all Epsilon windows.  The
maybe_refresh( ) primitive calls refresh( )≈refresh() only if there
is no type-ahead.  This is usually preferred since it lets Epsilon
catch up with the user's typing more quickly.  Epsilon calls the
latter primitive after each command executes.

Ωuser window char build_first;≤user buffer char must_build_mode;≤user char full_redraw;≤user char all_must_build_mode;≤æ≤
Epsilon normally displays each window line by line, omitting lines
that have not changed.  When a command has moved point out of the
window, Epsilon must reposition the display point (the buffer
position at which to start displaying text) to return point to the
window.  However, Epsilon sometimes does not know that repositioning
is required until it has displayed the entire window.  When it
discovers that point is not in the window, Epsilon moves the display
point to a new position and immediately displays the window again.
Certain commands which would often cause this annoying behavior set
the build_first≈build_first variable to prevent it.

When the build_first≈build_first variable is set, the next redisplay
constructs each window internally first, checks that point is in the
window, and only then displays it.  The variable is then set back to
zero.  A build_first≈build_first redisplay is slower than a normal
redisplay, but it never flashes an incorrect window.

make_mode() Pmake_mode(), subroutineEpsilon "precomputes" most of the text of each mode line, so it
doesn't have to figure out what to write each time it updates the
screen.  Setting the must_build_mode≈must_build_mode variable to 1 warns
Epsilon that any mode lines for the current buffer must be rebuilt.
The make_mode( ) subroutine in disp.e sets this to 1, and
Epsilon rebuilds the mode lines of all windows displaying this buffer.

Setting the all_must_build_mode≈all_must_build_mode variable to 1 is like setting
must_build_mode≈must_build_mode to 1 for all buffers.

Setting the full_redraw≈full_redraw variable rebuilds all mode lines, as
well as any precomputed information Epsilon may have on window
borders, screen colors, and so forth.

It is necessary to set full_redraw≈full_redraw when two parameters
affecting the display have been changed.  Make the full_redraw≈full_redraw
variable nonzero if the size of the tab character has changed, or if
the display class of any character has been changed via the
_display_class≈_display_class array.

Ωscreen_messed() Pscreen_messed(), primitivescreen_messed()≤æ≤
The screen_messed( ) primitive causes the next refresh( )
to completely redraw the entire screen.

ΩRdisplaycolumnuser window int display_column;≤æ≤

The window-specific variable display_column determines how
Epsilon displays long lines.  If negative, Epsilon displays buffer
lines too big to fit on one screen line on multiple screen lines,
with a ¥ or graphic character (see the
_display_characters variable described below) to indicate that
the line has been wrapped.  If display_column is 0 or positive,
Epsilon only displays the part of a line that fits on the screen.
Epsilon also skips over the initial display-column columns of
each line when displayed.  Horizontal scrolling works by adjusting
the display column.

Ωnext_screen_line()prev_screen_line() Pnext_screen_line(), primitive Pprev_screen_line(), primitiveint next_screen_line(int n)≤int prev_screen_line(int n)≤æ≤
The next_screen_line( ) primitive assumes point is at the
beginning of a screen line, and finds the nth screen line
following that one by counting columns.  It returns the position of
the start of that line.

The prev_screen_line( ) primitive is similar.  It
returns the start of the nth screen line before the one point
would be on.  It does not assume that point is at the start
of a screen line.

If Epsilon is scrolling long lines of text rather than wrapping them
(because display_column is greater than or equal to zero),
these primitives go to the beginning of the appropriate line in the
buffer, not the display_column'th column.  In this mode,
next_screen_line(1) is essentially the same as
nl_forward( ), and prev_screen_line(0) is like
πMto_begin_line( ).

4Video Modes

Ωuser char screen_mode;≤æ≤
In the DOS and OS/2 versions, the screen_mode≈screen_mode primitive is set
at startup to indicate what mode the display screen is in.  The value
of screen_mode is derived from the Interrupt 10 BIOS routine
(under DOS), and is set according to the following table:

Ω– 2 10 040 X 25 Black & White140 X 25 Color280 X 25 Black & White380 X 25 Color780 X 25 Monochrome—æ

ΩRscreenmodeshort screen_cols;≤short screen_lines;≤æ≤
The screen_cols≈screen_cols and screen_lines≈screen_lines
primitives contain the number of columns and lines on the display.
They are set when Epsilon starts up, using values provided by the
operating system (or, for the Windows version, by the registry or
Epsilon's .ini file).  Don't set these variables directly.  Use the
resize_screen( ) primitive described below.

Ω F-vc, command line flag F-vl, command line flagshort want_cols;≤short want_lines;≤æ≤
The want_cols≈want_cols and want_lines≈want_lines primitives contain the
values the user specified through the -vc and -vl switches,
respectively, described in Rvlswitchπvlswitch.  If these
variables are 0, it means the user did not explicitly specify the
number of lines or columns to display.

Ωterm_init()term_cmd_line()term_mode() Pterm_init(), subroutine Pterm_cmd_line(), subroutine Pterm_mode(), subroutineterm_init()             /* video.e */≤term_cmd_line()         /* video.e */≤term_mode(int active)   /* video.e */≤æ≤
Epsilon's standard startup code calls the subroutine
term_init( ) when you start Epsilon, and term_cmd_line( )
when it wants to switch to the video mode the user specified on the
command line.  (It switches video modes based on the command line
ªafterº it restores any saved session.)  The term_mode( )
subroutine controls switching when you exit Epsilon or run a
subprocess.  Its argument is 1 when entering Epsilon again (when
a shell( ) call returns, for example) and 0 when exiting.
The default versions of these functions implement the EGA and VGA
support described in REGAπEGA.

Ωresize_screen()when_resizing() Presize_screen(), primitive Pwhen_resizing(), subroutineresize_screen(int lines, int cols)≤when_resizing()    /* EEL subroutine */≤æ≤
The commands that change the screen size (see Rdisplaymodesπdisplaymodes) must do two things.  First they must change
the mode of the display device so that a different number of lines or
columns is displayed.  Then they must tell Epsilon to display a
different number of lines or columns.  They call the
resize_screen( ) primitive to do the latter.  It scales all the
windows to the new screen dimensions, and then sets the
screen_lines and screen_cols variables to the new screen
size.

After resizing the screen, the functions that switch video modes call
the when_resizing( ) subroutine.  By default, this does
nothing, but you can replace it to customize Epsilon's behavior at
this time.  (See Rmultipleπmultiple to make sure your extension
doesn't interfere with other extensions.)

4Character Display

Modifying the character array _display_class lets you alter the way
Epsilon displays characters.  There is one position in the array for
each of the 256 possible characters in a buffer.  The code at each
position determines how Epsilon displays the character when it
appears in a buffer.  This code is a ªdisplay codeº.

Epsilon lets each character occupy one or more screen positions.  For
example, the Control-A character is usually shown in two characters
on the screen as "^A".  The number of columns the ⁄Tab€
character occupies depends on the column it starts in.  Epsilon uses
the display codes 0 through 6 to produce the various
multi-character representations it is capable of, as described below.

Besides these multi-character display codes, Epsilon provides
a way to have one character display as another.  If the display
code of a character is not one of the special display codes 0 through
6, Epsilon interprets the display code as a graphics character.  This
graphics character becomes the single-column representation.

international
charactersFor example, if the display code for "A" is "B" (that is, if the
value of _display_class['A'] is the character "B"), wherever an
"A" appears in the buffer, a "B" will appear on the screen when
it is displayed.  The character is still really an "A", however:
only searches for "A" will find it, an "A" will be written if you
save the file, and so forth.  This facility is especially useful for
supporting international character sets.

foreign charactersIf a display code is from 0 to 6, it has a special meaning.  By
default, all characters have such a display code.  These numbers have
been given names in the file codes.h, and we'll use the names in
this discussion for clarity.

MBNORMAL PBNORMAL, textual macro PBNORMAL, textual macroEpsilon displays a character with display code BNORMAL as the
character itself.  If character 65, the letter 'A', has display code
BNORMAL it is the same as if it had display code 65.

MBTAB PBTAB, textual macroEpsilon displays a character with display code BTAB as a tab.
The character is displayed as the number of blanks necessary to reach
the next tab stop.  The buffer-specific primitive variable
¬tab-size≈tab-size sets the number of columns from one tab stop to the
next.  By default its value is eight.

MBNEWLINE PBNEWLINE, textual macroA character with display code BNEWLINE goes to the start of
the next line when displayed, as newline does normally.

MBCMBMMBMC PBC, textual macro PBM, textual macro PBMC, textual macroEpsilon displays a character with display code BC as a
control character.  It is displayed as the ^ character, followed
by the original character exclusive-or'ed with 64, and with the high
bit stripped.  BM and BMC are similar, with the
prefix being M- and M-^, respectively.

MBHEX PBHEX, textual macroFinally, Epsilon displays a character with display code BHEX
as a hexadecimal number in the form "xB7".  Specifically, the
representation has the letter 'x', then the two-character hexadecimal
character code.  You can change many of the characters Epsilon uses
for its representations of newlines, tabs, hex characters, and so
forth; see below.

meta characterseight bit characters PBTAB, textual macro PBNEWLINE, textual macro PBMC, textual macro PBNORMAL, textual macroBy default, the
tab character has code BTAB, the newline character has code
BNEWLINE, and the other control characters have code BC.
Control characters with the eighth bit set have code BMC.  All
other characters have code BNORMAL.

_std_disp_class V_std_disp_class, variableThe variable _display_class≈_display_class is actually a buffer-specific
pointer to the array of display codes.  Normally, all these pointers
refer to the same array, contained in the variable
_std_disp_class defined in cmdline.e.  You can create other
arrays if you wish to have different buffers display characters in
different ways.  Whenever you change the _display_class≈_display_class
variable, build_first≈build_first must be set to make the change take
effect, as described above.

_echo_display_class V_echo_display_class, variableWhen displaying text in the echo area, Epsilon uses the display class
array pointed to by the _echo_display_class variable.  It can
have the same values as _display_class.

Ω_display_charactersbuffer_display_characters P_display_characters, primitive Vbuffer_display_characters, buffer-specific variablechar _display_characters[ ];≤buffer char *buffer_display_characters;≤æ≤
It is possible to change the characters Epsilon uses to display
certain parts of the screen such as the border between windows.
Epsilon gets such characters from the _display_characters
array.  This array contains the line-drawing characters that form
window borders, the characters Epsilon uses in some of the display
modes set by set-show-graphic, the characters it uses to
construct the scroll bar, and the characters Epsilon replaces for the
graphical mouse cursor it normally uses in DOS.  The
¬set-display-characters command may be used to set these
characters.

If the buffer-specific variable buffer_display_characters is
non-null in a buffer, Epsilon uses it in place of the
_display_characters≈_display_characters variable whenever it displays that buffer.
You can use this to provide a special window border, scroll bar, or
similar for a particular buffer.  Epsilon's change-show-spaces
command uses this variable, too.

Ωexpand_display() Pexpand_display(), primitiveint expand_display(char *to, char *from)≤æ≤
The expand_display( ) primitive expands characters to the
multicharacter representations they would have if displayed on the
screen.  It returns the length of the result.

4Character Widths and Columns

 Pcolumn_to_pos(), subroutine Pmove_to_column(), primitive Pdisplay_width(), primitivecolumn_to_pos()move_to_column()display_width()Ωint display_width(int ch, int col)≤move_to_column(int col)≤int column_to_pos(int col)≤æ≤
The number of characters that fit on each screen line depends on the
display codes of the characters in the line.  Epsilon moves
characters with multi-character representations as a unit to the next
screen line when they don't fit at the end of the previous one
(except in horizontal scrolling mode).  Tab characters also vary in
width depending upon the column they start in.  There are several
primitives that count screen columns using display class information.

The display_width( ) primitive is the simplest.  It returns
the width a character ch would have if it were at column col.
The move_to_column( ) primitive moves to column col in
the current line, or to the end of the line if it does not reach to
column col.  The column_to_pos( ) subroutine accepts a
column number but doesn't move point; instead it returns the
buffer position of that column.

Ωhorizontal()current_column()get_column()get_indentation() Phorizontal(), primitive PBNEWLINE, textual macro Pcurrent_column(), primitive Pget_column(), subroutine Pget_indentation(), subroutineint horizontal(int pos)≤int current_column()≤int get_column(int pos)         /* indent.e */≤int get_indentation(int pos)    /* indent.e */≤to_column(int col)              /* indent.e */≤indent_to_column(int col)       /* indent.e */≤indent_like_tab()               /* indent.e */≤æ≤
The horizontal( ) primitive returns the number of columns from
point to position pos.  Point doesn't change.  It must be
before pos.  The primitive returns -1 if there is a character
of display code πMBNEWLINE between point and pos.  This primitive
assumes that point is in column 0.

The current_column( ) primitive uses the horizontal( )≈horizontal()
primitive to return the number of the current column.

The get_column( ) subroutine returns the column number of a
given buffer position.  The get_indentation( ) subroutine
returns the indentation of the line containing position pos.

to_column() Pto_column(), subroutineThe to_column( ) subroutine indents so that the character
immediately after point winds up in column col.  It replaces any
spaces and tabs before point with the new indentation.  It doesn't
modify any characters after point.

indent_to_column() Pindent_to_column(), subroutineThe indent_to_column( ) subroutine indents so that the next
non-whitespace character on the line winds up in column col.  It
replaces any spaces and tabs before or after point.

indent_like_tab() Pindent_like_tab(), subroutineThe indent_like_tab( ) subroutine indents like inserting a
⁄Tab€ character at point would.  However, it respects the
¬indent-with-tabs≈indent-with-tabs variable and avoids using tabs when the
variable is zero.  It also converts spaces and tabs immediately
before point so that they match indent-with-tabs and use the
minimum number of characters.

Ωforce_to_column() Pforce_to_column(), subroutineforce_to_column(int col)    /* indent.e */≤æ≤
The force_to_column( ) subroutine tries to move to column
col.  If the line doesn't reach to that column, the function
indents out to the column.  If the column occurs inside a tab
character, the function converts the tab to spaces.

Ωuser window short cursor_to_column;≤to_virtual_column(int col)  /* basic.e */≤int virtual_column()        /* basic.e */≤æ≤
The window-specific cursor_to_column≈cursor_to_column variable lets you
position the cursor in a part of a window where there are no
characters.  It's normally -1, and the cursor stays on the
character after point.  If it's non-negative in the current window,
Epsilon puts the cursor at the specified column in the window
instead.  Epsilon resets cursor_to_column to -1 whenever
the buffer changes, or point moves from where it was when you last
set cursor_to_column.  (Epsilon only checks these conditions
when it redisplays the window, so you can safely move point
temporarily.)

Similarly, the window-specific mark_to_column≈mark_to_column variable lets
you position the mark in a part of a window where there are no
characters.  Epsilon uses this variable when it displays a region
that runs to the mark's position, and swaps the variable with
cursor_to_column when you exchange the point and mark.  It's
normally -1, so Epsilon highlights up to the actual buffer
position of the mark.  If it's non-negative in the current window,
Epsilon highlights up to the specified column instead.  Epsilon
resets mark_to_column to -1 just as described above for
cursor_to_column.

to_virtual_column() Pto_virtual_column(), subroutineThe to_virtual_column( ) subroutine positions the cursor to
column col on the current line.  It tries to simply move to the
correct position in the buffer, but if no buffer character begins at
that column, it uses the cursor_to_column variable to get the
cursor to the right place.

virtual_column() Pvirtual_column(), subroutineThe virtual_column( ) subroutine provides the column the cursor
would appear in: either the value of the cursor_to_column
variable, or (if it's negative) the current column.

Ωtab_convert()hack_tabs()maybe_indent_rigidly() Ptab_convert(), subroutine Phack_tabs(), subroutine Pmaybe_indent_rigidly(), subroutinetab_convert(int from, int to, int totabs)≤hack_tabs(int offset)≤int maybe_indent_rigidly(int rev)≤æ≤
The tab_convert( ) subroutine converts tabs to spaces in the
specified region when its parameter totabs is zero.  When
totabs is nonzero, it converts spaces to tabs.

The hack_tabs( ) subroutine converts tabs to spaces in the
offset columns following point.  If offset is negative, the
function converts tabs in the columns preceding point.

Commands bound to ⁄Tab€ often call the
maybe_indent_rigidly( ) subroutine.  If a region's been
highlighted, this subroutine indents it using the
indent-rigidly command and then returns nonzero.  Otherwise,
it returns zero.  If its parameter rev is nonzero, the subroutine
unindents; a command bound to Shift-⁄Tab€ often provides a
nonzero rev, but for commands on ⁄Tab€ this is typically zero.

Ωindenterprev_indenter() Vindenter, variable Pprev_indenter(), subroutinebuffer int (*indenter)(); /* EEL variable */≤user buffer int auto_indent;   /* EEL variable */≤prev_indenter()           /* indent.e */≤æ≤
The normal-character command provides a hook for automatic
line indentation when it inserts the newline character.  If the
buffer-specific variable ¬auto-indent≈auto-indent is nonzero, the
normal-character command will call the function pointed to by
the variable indenter, a buffer-specific function pointer,
after inserting a newline character.  By default, it calls the
prev_indenter( ) subroutine, which indents to the same
indentation as the previous line.

3Displaying Status Messages

 Psayput(), primitive Psay(), primitivesayput()say()Ωint say(char *format, ...)≤int sayput(char *format, ...)≤æ≤
The say( ) primitive displays text in the echo area.  It
takes a printf-style format string, and zero or more other
parameters, as described in Rprintfπprintf.  The
sayput( ) primitive is similar, but it positions the cursor
at the end of the string.  Each returns the number of characters
displayed.

Ωnote()noteput()unseen_msgs() Pnote(), primitive Pnoteput(), primitive Punseen_msgs(), primitiveint note(char *format, ...)≤int noteput(char *format, ...)≤int unseen_msgs()≤drop_pending_says()≤short expire_message;≤æ≤
When you use the say( ), sayput( ), or error( )
primitives (error( )'s description appears in Rabortingπaborting) to display a message to the user, Epsilon ensures
that it remains on the screen long enough for the user to see it (the
¬see-delay≈see-delay variable controls just how long) by delaying future
messages.  Messages that must remain on the screen for a certain
length of time are called ªtimed messagesº.

The note( ) and noteput( ) primitives work like
say( ) and sayput( ), respectively, but their messages can be
overwritten immediately.  They should be used for "status" messages
that don't need to last ("95% done", for example).

drop_pending_says() Pdrop_pending_says(), primitiveThe unseen_msgs( ) primitive returns the number of unexpired
timed messages.  When the user presses a key, and there are unseen
messages, Epsilon immediately displays the most recent message
waiting to be displayed, and discards all pending timed messages.
The drop_pending_says( ) primitive does the same.  It cancels
any pending timed messages, so that the next say( ), note( ),
or similar will appear immediately.  It returns 0 if there were
no timed messages, or 1 if there were.

An EEL function sometimes needs to display some text in the echo area
that is only valid until the user performs some action.  For
instance, a command that displays the number of characters in the
buffer might wish to clear that count if the user inserts or deletes
some characters.  After displaying text with one of the primitives
above, an EEL function may set the ¬expire_message≈expire_message variable to
1 to tell Epsilon to clear that text on the next user key.

Ωshow_text() Pshow_text(), primitiveint show_text(int column, int time, char *fmt, ...)≤æ≤
The show_text( ) primitive is the most general command for
displaying text in the echo area.  Like the other display primitives,
it takes a printf-style format string, and returns the number of
characters it displayed.

When Epsilon displays text in the echo area, you can tell it to begin
at a particular column, and Epsilon will subdivide the echo area into
two sections.  You can then display different messages in each area
independently of one another.  When it's necessary to display a very
long message, Epsilon will combine the sections again and use the
full display width.  There are never more than two sections in the
echo area.

In detail, the show_text( ) primitive tells Epsilon to begin
displaying text in the echo area at the specified column, where the
leftmost column is column 0.  Epsilon then clears the rest of
that echo area section, but doesn't modify the other section.

Whenever you specify a column greater than zero in show_text( ),
Epsilon will subdivide the echo area at that column.  It will clear
any text to the right of the newly-displayed text, but not any text
to its left.

Epsilon will recombine the sections of the echo area under two
conditions: whenever you write text starting in column 0 that begins
to overwrite the next section, and whenever you write the empty
string "" at column 0.  When Epsilon recombines sections, it
erases the entire echo area before writing the new text.

Specifying a column of -1 acts just like specifying column 0,
making Epsilon display the text at the left margin, but it also tells
Epsilon to position the cursor right after the text.

The time says how long in milliseconds Epsilon must display the
message before moving on and displaying the next message, if any.  As
with any timed message, when the user presses a key, Epsilon
immediately displays the last message waiting, skipping through any
pending messages.  A value of 0 for time means the message
doesn't have to remain for any fixed length of time.  A value of
-1 means that Epsilon may not go on to the next message until it
receives a keystroke; such messages will never time out.

Most of the other echo area display primitives are equivalent to some
form of show_text( ), as shown in the following table:

Ωnote("abc")                     show_text(0, 0, "abc")≤say("abc")                      show_text(0, see_delay, "abc")≤noteput("abc")                  show_text(-1, 0, "abc")≤sayput("abc")                   show_text(-1, see_delay, "abc")≤æ≤
≤Ωmention() Pmention(), primitiveint mention(char *format, ...)≤user char mention_delay;≤æ≤
The mention( ) primitive acts like sayput( )≈sayput(), but
displays its string only after Epsilon has paused waiting for user
input for ¬mention_delay≈mention_delay tenths of a second.  It doesn't cause
Epsilon to wait for input, it just arranges things so that if Epsilon
does wait for input and the required delay elapses, the message is
displayed and the wait continues.  Writing to the echo area with
say( )≈say() or the like cancels any pending mention( )≈mention().  By
default, mention_delay is 0.

Ωmuldiv() Pmuldiv(), primitiveint muldiv(int a, int b, int c)≤æ≤
The muldiv( ) primitive takes its arguments and returns the
value ªa * b / cº, performing this computation using 64-bit
arithmetic.  It's useful in such tasks as showing "percentage
complete" while operating on a large buffer.  Simply writing
point * 100 / size() in EEL would use 32-bit arithmetic, as EEL
always does, and on large buffers (over about 20 megabytes) the
result would be wrong.

3Printf-style Format Strings

format stringPrintf-style format stringsRprintf
Primitives like say( ) along with several others take a
particular pattern of arguments.  The first argument is required.  It
is a character pointer called the ªformat stringº.  The contents
of the format string determine what other arguments are necessary.

Characters in the format string are copied to the echo area except
where a percent character "%" appears.  The percent
begins a sequence which interpolates the value of an additional
argument into the text that will appear in the echo area.  The
sequence has the following pattern, in which square brackets [ ]
enclose optional items:

Ω% [ - ] [ number ] [ . number ] characteræ

In this pattern »number… may be either a string of digits or the
character "*".  If the latter, the next argument provided to
the primitive must be an int, and its value is used in place of the
digits.

The meaning of the sequence depends on the final character:
Œc The next argument must be an int.  (As explained previously, a
character argument is changed to an int when a function is
called, so it's fine here too.)  The character with that ASCII code
is inserted in the displayed text.  For example, if the argument is
65 or 'A', the letter A appears, since the code for A is 65.

Œd The next argument must be an int.  A sequence of characters
for the decimal representation of that number is inserted in the
displayed text.  For example, if the argument is 65 the characters "6"
and "5" are produced.

Œx The next argument must be an int.  A sequence of characters
for the hexadecimal (base 16) representation of that number is
inserted in the displayed text.  For example, if the argument is 65
the characters "4" and "1" are produced (since the
hexadecimal number 0x41 is equal to 65 in base 10).  No minus sign
appears with this representation.

Œo The next argument must be an int.  A sequence of characters
for the octal representation of that number is inserted
in the displayed text.  For example, if the argument is 65 the
three characters "101" are produced (since the octal number 101 is
equal to 65 in base 10).  No minus sign appears with this
representation.

Œs The next argument, which must be a string, is copied to
the displayed text.

Œq The next argument, which must be a string, is copied to
the displayed text, but quoted for inclusion in a regular expression.
In other words, any characters from the original string that have a
special meaning in regular expressions are copied with a percent
character ("%") before them.  See Rregexπregex for
information on regular expressions.

Œr The next argument (which must be a string containing a file
name in absolute form) is copied to the displayed text, after being
converted to relative form.  Epsilon calls the relative( )
primitive, described in Rabsoluteπabsolute, to do this.


The first number, if present, is the width of the field the argument
will be printed in.  At least that many characters will be produced,
and more if the argument will not fit in the given width.  If no
number is present, exactly as many characters as are required will be
used.

The extra space will normally be put before the characters generated
from the argument.  If a minus sign is present before the first
number, however, the space will be put at the end instead.

If the first number begins with the digit 0, the extra space will be
filled with zeros instead of spaces.  A minus sign before the first
number is ignored in this case.

The second number, if present, is the maximum number of characters
from the string that will be displayed.  For example, each of these
lines displays the text, "Just an example":

Ωsay("Just ≥.2s example", "another");≤≤say("Just ≥.*s example", 7-5, "another");≤æ≤
It may be tempting to substitute a string variable for the first
parameter of say( )≈say().  For example, when writing a function that
displays its argument msg and pauses, it may seem natural to
write say(msg);.  This will work fine unless msg contains a
"%" character.  In that case, you will probably get an
error message.  Use say("%s", msg); instead.

ΩRinechoareauser char in_echo_area;≤æ≤
The in_echo_area≈in_echo_area variable controls whether the cursor is
positioned at point in the buffer, or in the echo area at the bottom
of the screen.  The sayput( )≈sayput() primitive sets this variable,
say( )≈say() resets it, and it is reset after each
command.

3Other Display Primitives

 Pterm_write_attr(), primitive Pterm_write(), primitive Pterm_position(), primitive Pterm_clear(), primitiveterm_write_attr()term_write()term_position()term_clear()Ωterm_write(int col, int row, char *str, int count,≤           int colorclass, int clear)≤term_write_attr(int col, int row, int chartowrite,≤                int attrtowrite)≤term_clear()≤term_position(int col, int row)≤æ≤
The following primitives provide low-level screen control.  The
term_clear( ) primitive clears the screen.  The
term_position( ) primitive positions the cursor to the
indicated row and column.  The term_write( ) primitive puts
characters directly on the screen.  It puts count characters from
str on the screen at the row and column in the specified
colorclass.  If clear is nonzero, it clears the rest of the
line.  The term_write_attr( ) primitive writes a single
character at the specified location on the screen.  Unlike
term_write( ), which takes a color class, this primitive takes a
raw foreground/background color attribute pair.  This primitive does
nothing in Epsilon for Windows or under the X windowing system.  For
all these primitives, row and col start at 0, and the
coordinate 0,0 refers to the upper left corner of the screen.  If a
keyboard macro is running, the term_ primitives are ignored.

During screen refresh, Epsilon calls the EEL subroutine
fix_cursor( ) to set the shape of the cursor.  The
subroutine chooses one of four variables depending upon the current
modes, and copies its value into the cursor_shape≈cursor_shape variable,
which holds the current cursor shape code.  The Windows and X
versions set the gui_cursor_shape≈gui_cursor_shape variable in a similar way,
from a different set of four variables.  All these variables use
values constructed by the CURSOR_SHAPE() macro.  See Rcursorshapeπcursorshape for details on these variables.

Under Windows, the windows_set_font( ) primitive displays a
font selection dialog, allowing the user to pick a different font.
It takes two parameters.  Title specifies the title of the dialog
box to display.  The fnt_code says whether to set Epsilon's main
font (FNT_SCREEN), the font for printing
(FNT_PRINTER), or the font for Epsilon's dialogs
(FNT_DIALOG).

Ωusing_oem_font()using_new_font Pusing_oem_font(), primitive Pusing_new_font, primitiveint using_oem_font(int screen)≤char using_new_font;≤æ≤
The using_oem_font( ) primitive returns a nonzero value if
the specified screen's font uses the OEM character set, rather than
the ANSI/Windows character set.  It takes a screen number.  This
primitive always returns 1 under DOS and OS/2 and 0 under Unix.  The
primitive variable using_new_font will be nonzero whenever
some screen's font has been changed since the end of the last screen
refresh (or when a new screen has been created, for example by
displaying a dialog).

3Highlighted Regions

 PREGLINE, textual macro PREGRECT, textual macro PREGNORM, textual macroMREGLINEMREGRECTMREGNORMEpsilon can display portions of a buffer in a different color than
the rest of the buffer.  We call each such portion a region.  The
most familiar region is the one between point and mark.  Epsilon
defines this region automatically each time you create a new buffer.
(Also see the description of character coloring in Rsetcharactercolorπset-character-color.)

Epsilon can display a region in several ways.  The most common method
corresponds to the one you see when you set the mark (by typing
Ctrl-@) and then move around: Epsilon highlights each of the
characters between point and mark.  If you use the
mark-rectangle command on Ctrl-X # to define a rectangular
region, the highlighting appears on all columns between point and
mark, on all lines between point and mark.  The pop-up windows of the
completion facility illustrate a third type of highlighting, where
complete lines appear highlighted.  The header file codes.h defines
these types of regions as (respectively) REGNORM,
REGRECT, and REGLINE.  Epsilon won't do any
highlighting for a region that has type 0.

MREGINCL PREGINCL, textual macroA fourth type of highlighting, REGINCL, is similar to
REGNORM, but includes an additional character at the end of the
region.  If a REGNORM region runs between position 10 and
position 20 in the buffer, Epsilon would highlight the 10 characters
between the two positions.  But if the region were a REGINCL
region, it would include 11 characters: the characters at positions
10 and 20, and all the characters between.

Ωadd_region() Padd_region(), primitiveint add_region(spot from, spot to, int color, int type, ?int handle)≤remove_region(int handle)≤int modify_region(int handle, int code, int val)≤window char _highlight_control;≤æ≤
You can define new regions with add_region( ).  It takes a
pair of spots, a color class expression such as color_class
highlight, a region display type (as described above), and,
optionally, a numeric "handle".  It returns a nonzero numeric
handle which you can use to refer to the region later.  You can
provide the spots in either order, and you may give the same spot
twice (for example, in conjunction with REGLINE, to always
highlight a single line).  See Rcolclassπcolclass for basic
information on color classes, and Rcolorclasssyntaxπcolor-class-syntax
for details on the syntax of color class expressions).

modify_region()remove_region() Pmodify_region(), primitive Premove_region(), primitiveWhen you omit the handle parameter to add_region( ) (or
provide a handle of zero) add_region( ) assigns an unused
handle to the new region.  You can also provide the handle of an
existing region, and add_region( ) will assign the same handle to
the new region.  Any changes you make to one region by using
modify_region( ) will now apply to both, and a single
remove_region( ) call will remove both.  You can link any
number of regions in the same buffer in this way.  The special handle
value 1 refers to the region between point and mark that Epsilon
creates automatically.

The remove_region( )≈remove_region() primitive takes a region handle, and
deletes all regions with that handle.  The handle may belong to a
region in another buffer.  Epsilon signals an error if the handle
doesn't refer to any region.

MMRSTARTMMRENDMMRCOLORMMRTYPEMMRCONTROL PMRSTART, textual macro PMREND, textual macro PMRCOLOR, textual macro PMRTYPE, textual macro PMRCONTROL, textual macroThe modify_region( )≈modify_region() primitive retrieves or sets some of the
attributes of one or more regions.  It takes a region handle, a
modify code (one of MRSTART, MREND, MRCOLOR,
MRTYPE, or MRCONTROL), and a new value.  If you provide
a "new value" of -1, Epsilon will not change the attribute, but
will simply return its value.  If you provide a new value other than
-1, Epsilon will set that attribute of the region, and will return
its previous value.

The modify codes MRCOLOR and MRTYPE may be
used to get or change a region's color and display type.  The codes
MRSTART and MREND may be used to set the two spots of a
region; however, Epsilon will not return the spot identifier for a
region, but rather its current buffer position.

When several regions share the same handle, it's possible they will
have different color codes or display types.  In this case, which
region's code Epsilon returns is undefined.

You can set up a region to be "controlled" by any numeric global
variable.  Epsilon will display the region only if the variable is
nonzero.  This is especially useful because the variable may be
window-specific.  Since regions are associated with buffers, this is
needed so that a buffer displayed in two windows can have a region
that appears in only one of them.

_highlight_control P_highlight_control, primitive PMRCONTROL, textual macroThe standard region between point and mark is controlled by the
window-specific character variable _highlight_control.  By
default, other regions are not controlled by any variable.  The
modify code MRCONTROL may be used with modify_region( ) to
associate a controlling variable with a region.  Provide the global
variable's name table index (obtainable through find_index( )) as
the value to set.

Several subroutines let you conveniently control highlighting of the
standard region between point and mark.  To set the type of the
region, call the subroutine set_region_type( ) with the
region type code, one of πMREGNORM, πMREGRECT, πMREGLINE,
or πMREGINCL.  This doesn't automatically turn on highlighting.
Call highlight_on( ) to turn on highlighting, or
highlight_off( ) to turn it off.

The region_type( ) subroutine returns the type of the
current region, whether or not it's currently highlighted.  The
is_highlight_on( ) subroutine returns the type of the
current region, but only if it's highlighted.  It returns 0 if
highlighting is off.

There are several subroutines that help you write functions that work
with different types of regions.  If you've written a function that
operates on the text of a normal Epsilon region, add the following
lines at the beginning of your function to make it work with
inclusive regions and line regions as well:

Ωfix_region() Pfix_region(), subroutinesave_spot point, mark;≤fix_region();≤æ≤
When the user has highlighted an inclusive or line region, the
fix_region( ) subroutine will reposition point and
mark to form a normal Epsilon region with the same characters.
(For example, in the case of a line region, Epsilon moves point to
the beginning of the line.)  The function also swaps point and
mark so that point comes first (or equals mark, if the
region happens to be empty).  This is often convenient.

This procedure assumes your function doesn't plan to modify
point or mark, just the characters between them, and it
makes sure that point and mark remain in the same place.
If your function needs to reposition the point or mark, try omitting
the save_spot line.  Your function will be responsible for
determining where the point and mark wind up.

fill_rectangle() Pfill_rectangle(), subroutineA function needs to do more work to operate on rectangular regions.
If it's built to operate on all the characters in a region, without
regard to rectangles or columns, the simplest approach may be to
extract the rectangle into a temporary buffer, modify it there, and
then replace the rectangle in the original buffer.  Several Epsilon
subroutines help you do this.  For a concrete example, let's look at
the function fill_rectangle( ), defined in format.e.  The
fill-region command calls this function when the current
region is rectangular.

Ωfill_rectangle(marg) // fill parags in rectangle betw point and mark≤{          // to marg columns (relative to rectangle's width if <=0)≤        int width, orig = bufnum, b = tmp_buf();≤≤        width = extract_rectangle(b, 0);≤        save_var bufnum = b;≤        mark = 0;≤        margin_right = marg + (marg <= 0 ? width : 0);≤        do_fill_region();≤        xfer_rectangle(orig, width, 1);≤        buf_delete(b);≤}≤æ≤
The function begins by allocating a temporary buffer using
tmp_buf( ).  Then it calls the extract_rectangle( )
subroutine to copy the rectangle into the temporary buffer.  This
function returns the width of the rectangle it copied.  The call from
fill_rectangle( ) passes the destination buffer number as the
first parameter.  Then fill_rectangle( ) switches to the
temporary buffer and reformats the text.  Finally, the subroutine
copies the text back into its rectangle by calling
xfer_rectangle( ) and deletes the temporary buffer.  If the
operation you want to perform on the text in the rectangle depends on
any buffer-specific variables, be sure to copy them to the temporary
buffer.

Now let's look at the two rectangle-manipulating subroutines
fill_rectangle( ) calls in more detail.

Ωextract_rectangle() Pextract_rectangle(), subroutineextract_rectangle(int copybuf, int remove)≤æ≤
The extract_rectangle( ) subroutine operates on the region
between point and mark in the current buffer.  It treats the region
as a rectangle, whether or not region_type( ) returns
πMREGRECT.  It can perform several different actions, depending
upon its parameters.  If copybuf is nonzero, the subroutine
inserts a copy of the rectangle into the buffer with that buffer
number.  The buffer must already exist.

If remove is 1, the subroutine deletes the characters
inside the rectangle.  If remove is 2, the subroutine
replaces the characters with spaces.  If remove is 0, the
subroutine doesn't change the original rectangle.

The subroutine always leaves point at the upper left corner of the
rectangle and mark at the lower right.  It return the width of the
rectangle.

Ωxfer_rectangle() Pxfer_rectangle(), subroutinexfer_rectangle(int dest, int width, int overwrite)≤æ≤
The xfer_rectangle( ) subroutine inserts the current buffer as
a rectangle of the given width into buffer number dest,
starting at dest's current point.  If overwrite is nonzero,
the subroutine copies on top of any existing columns.  Otherwise it
inserts new columns.  In the destination buffer, it leaves point at
the top left corner of the new rectangle, and mark at the bottom
right.  The point remains at the same position in the original buffer.

ΩRshift-selectsdo_shift_selects() Pdo_shift_selects(), subroutinedo_shift_selects()≤æ≤
Commands bound to cursor keys typically select
text when you hold down the shift key.  They do this by calling
do_shift_selects( ) as they start.  This routine looks at
the current state of the shift key and whether or not highlighting is
already on, and turns highlighting on or off as needed, possibly
setting point.

While Epsilon is capable of treating the shifted cursor pad keys as
completely different keys from their unshifted counterparts, normally
it sets its keytran array to translate the shifted keys to their
unshifted versions.  This means that if you change the binding of
⁄Down€, the shifted version of the key will change as well.  But
this introduces a complication involving keyboard macros.

MEXTEND_SEL_KEY PEXTEND_SEL_KEY, textual macroKeyboard macros don't automatically record the state of the shift
key, unless it figures into the character that they record.  (In
other words, they distinguish 5 from %, but they don't
distinguish shifted and unshifted cursor pad keys.)  So if you're
recording a macro when you use a shifted cursor key, this subroutine
modifies the key code of the cursor key by adding the bit flag
EXTEND_SEL_KEY to it.  Epsilon displays such shifted keys
with a notation like E-<Down>.

Ωmake_line_highlight()remove_line_highlight() Pmake_line_highlight(), subroutine Premove_line_highlight(), subroutinemake_line_highlight()     /* complete.e */≤remove_line_highlight()   /* complete.e */≤æ≤
The make_line_highlight( ) subroutine uses the
add_region( ) primitive to create a region that highlights the
current line of the current buffer.  When Epsilon puts up a menu of
options, it uses this function to keep the current line highlighted.
The remove_line_highlight( ) subroutine gets rid of such
highlighting.

3Character Coloring

You can set the color of individual characters using the
set_character_color( ) primitive.  At first glance, this feature
may seem similar to Epsilon's mechanism for defining highlighted
regions.  Both let you specify a range of characters and a color to
display them with.  But each has its own advantages.

Region highlighting can highlight the text in different ways: as a
rectangle, expanded to entire lines, and so forth, while character
coloring has no similar options.  You can define a highlighted region
that moves around with the point, the mark, or any other spot.
Character coloring always remains with the characters.

But when there are many colored regions, using character coloring is
much faster than creating a corresponding set of highlighted regions.
If you define more than a few dozen highlighted regions, Epsilon's
screen refreshes will begin to slow down.  Character coloring, on the
other hand, is designed to be very fast, even when there are
thousands of colored areas.  Character coloring is also easier to use
for many tasks, since it doesn't require the programmer to allocate
spots to delimit the ends of the colored region, or delete them when
the region is no longer needed.

One more difference is the way you remove the coloring.  For
highlighted regions, you can turn off the coloring temporarily by
calling modify_region( ), or eliminate the region entirely by
calling remove_region( ).  To do either of these, you must supply
the region's handle, a value returned when the region was first
created.  On the other hand, to remove character coloring, you can
simply set the desired range of characters to the special color
-1.  A program using character coloring doesn't need to store a
series of handles to remove or modify the coloring.

Epsilon's code coloring functions are built on top of the character
coloring primitives described in this section.  See the next section
for information on the higher-level functions that make code coloring
work.

ΩRset-character-colorset_character_color() Pset_character_color(), primitive Pbuf_xfer_colors(), subroutineset_character_color(int pos1, int pos2, int color)≤æ≤
The set_character_color( ) primitive
makes Epsilon display characters between pos1 and pos2
using the specified color class.  Epsilon discards any previous color
settings of characters in that range.

A color class of -1 means the text will be "uncolored".  To
display uncolored text, Epsilon uses the standard color class
text.  When a buffer is first created, every character is
uncolored.

When you insert text in a buffer, it takes on the color of the
character immediately after it, or in the case of the last character
in the buffer, the character immediately before it.  Characters
inserted in an empty buffer are initially uncolored.  Copying text
from one buffer to another does not automatically transfer the color;
Epsilon treats the new characters the same as any other inserted
text.  You can use the buf_xfer_colors( ) subroutine to copy
text from one buffer to another and retain its coloring.  See Rbufxfercolorsπbufxfercolors.

Epsilon maintains the character colors set by this primitive
independently of the highlighted regions created by
add_region( ).  The modify_region( ) primitive will never
change what get_character_color( ) returns, and similarly the
set_character_color( ) primitive never changes the attributes of
a region you create with add_region( ).  When Epsilon displays
text, it combines information from both sources to determine the
final color of each character.

When displaying a buffer, Epsilon uses the following procedure when
determining which color class to use for a character:

 Make a list of all old-style highlighted regions that contain
the character, and the color classes used for each.

 Add the character's color as set by set_character_color( )
to this list.

 Remove color classes of -1 from the list.



Next, Epsilon chooses a color class from the list:

 If the list of color classes is empty, use the text color class.

 Otherwise, if the list contains the highlight color class,
use that.

 Otherwise, use the color class from the old-style highlighted region
with the highest region number.  If there are no old-style
highlighted regions in the list, the list must contain only one color
class, so use that.

 Finally, if we wound up selecting the text color class, and
the text_color variable isn't equal to color_class text,
use the color class in the text_color variable instead of the
color_class text.



Notice that when a region using the highlight color class
overlaps another region, the highlight color class takes
precedence.

Ωget_character_color() Pget_character_color(), primitiveshort get_character_color(int pos, ?int *startp, ?int *endp)≤æ≤
The get_character_color( ) primitive returns the color class
for the character at the specified buffer position, as set by
set_character_color( ), or -1 if the character is uncolored,
and will be displayed using the window's default color class.

You can also use the primitive to determine the extent of a range of
characters all in the same color.  If the optional pointer parameters
startp and endp are non-null, Epsilon fills in the locations they
point to with buffer positions.  These specify the largest region of
the buffer containing characters the same color as the one at pos,
and including pos.  For example, if the buffer contains a
five-character word that has been colored blue, the buffer is
otherwise uncolored, and pos refers to the second character in
the word, then Epsilon will set *startp to pos - 1 and
*endp to pos + 4.

ΩRtaggedregionsset_tagged_region()get_tagged_region()tagged regions Pset_tagged_region(), primitive Pget_tagged_region(), primitiveset_tagged_region(char *tag, int from, int to, short val)≤short get_tagged_region(char *tag, int pos, ?int *from, int *to)≤æ≤
The character coloring
primitives above are actually built from a more general facility that
allows you to associate a set of attributes with a buffer range.

Each set of attributes consists of a tag (a unique
string like "my-tag") and, for each character in the buffer, a number
that represents the attribute.  Each buffer has its own set of tags, and each
tag has its own list of attributes, one for each character.  (Epsilon stores
the numbers in a way that's efficient when many adjacent characters have the
same number, but nothing prevents each character from having a different
attribute.)

The set_tagged_region( ) primitive sets the attribute of the
characters in the range from to to, for the specified tag.

The get_tagged_region( ) primitive gets the attribute of the
character at position pos in the buffer.  If you provide pointers
from and to, Epsilon will fill these in to indicate the largest range
of characters adjacent to pos that have the same attribute as pos.

Epsilon's character color primitives set_character_color( ) and
get_character_color( ) use a built-in tagged region with a tag name of
"colors".

3Code Coloring Internals

RcodecolorinternalsEpsilon's code coloring routines use the
character coloring primitives above to do code coloring for various
languages like C, TeX, and HTML.  There are some general purpose code
coloring functions that manage code coloring and decide what sections
of a buffer need to be colored.  Then, for each language, there are
functions that know how to color text in that language.

The general purpose section maintains information on what parts of
each buffer have already been colored.  It divides each buffer into
sections that are already correctly colored, and sections that may
not be correctly colored.  When the buffer changes, it moves its
divisions so that the modified text is no longer marked "correctly
colored".  Whenever Epsilon displays part of a buffer, this part of
code coloring recolors sections of the buffer as needed, and marks
them so they won't be colored again unless the buffer changes.
Epsilon only displays the buffer after the appropriate section has
been correctly colored.  This part also arranges to color additional
sections of the buffer whenever Epsilon is idle, until the buffer has
been completely colored.

The other part of code coloring does the actual coloring of C, TeX,
and HTML buffers.  You can write new EEL functions to tell Epsilon
how to color other languages, and use the code coloring package's
mechanisms for remembering which parts of the buffer have already
been colored, and which need to be recolored.  This section describes
how to do this.  (Also see Rcodecolorhowtoπcodecolorhowto.)

Ωbuffer int (*recolor_range)();    // how to color part of this buffer≤buffer int (*recolor_from_here)(); // how to find a good starting pos≤int color_c_range(int from, int to)  // how to color part of C buffer≤int color_c_from_here(int safe)  // how to find starting pos in C buffer≤buffer char coloring_flags;≤#define COLOR_DO_COLORING           1≤#define COLOR_IN_PROGRESS           2≤#define COLOR_MINIMAL               4≤#define COLOR_INVALIDATE_FORWARD    8≤#define COLOR_INVALIDATE_BACKWARD   16≤#define COLOR_INVALIDATE_RESETS     32≤æ≤
You must first write two functions and make the buffer-specific
function pointers refer to them, in each buffer you want to color.
For C/C++/EEL buffers, the c-mode command takes care of
setting the function pointers.  It also contains the lines

Ωrecolor_rangecolor_c_range() Vrecolor_range, variable Pcolor_c_range(), subroutineif (want_code_coloring)≤        when_setting_want_code_coloring();≤æ≤
to actually turn on code coloring for the buffer if necessary.

The first function, which must be stored in the buffer-specific
recolor_range variable, does the actual coloring of a part
of the buffer.  It takes two parameters from and to
specifying the range of the buffer that needs coloring.  It colors at
least the specified range, but it may go past to and color more
of the buffer.  It returns the buffer position it reached, indicating
that all characters between from and its return value are now
correctly colored.  In C buffers, the recolor_range function is
named color_c_range( ).

The recolor_range function may decide to mark some characters
in the range "uncolored", by calling set_character_color( )
with a color class of -1.  Or it may assign particular color
classes to all parts of the range to be colored.  But either way, it
should make sure all characters in the given range are correctly
colored.  Typically, a function begins by setting all characters
between from and to to a default color class, then
searching for elements which should be colored differently.  Be sure
that if you extend the range past to, you color all the
characters between to and your new stopping point.

Epsilon remembers which parts of the buffer require coloring by using
a tagged region (see Rtaggedregionsπtaggedregions) named
"needs-color".  A coloring routine may decide, while parsing a
buffer, that some later or earlier section of the buffer requires
coloring; if so, it can set the needs-color attribute of that
section to -1 to indicate this, and Epsilon will recolor that
section of the buffer the next time it's needed.  Or it can declare
that some other section of the buffer is already properly colored by
setting that section's attribute to 0.

When the buffer's modified, some of its coloring becomes invalid, and
must be recomputed the next time it's needed.  Normally Epsilon
invalidates a few lines surrounding the changed section.  Some
language modes tell Epsilon to automatically invalidate more of the
buffer by setting flags in the buffer-specific
\bufvar{coloring_flags} variable.  (Other flags in this variable
aren't normally set by language modes; code coloring uses them for
bookkeeping purposes.)

 PCOLOR_INVALIDATE_FORWARD, textual macro PCOLOR_INVALIDATE_BACKWARD, textual macro PCOLOR_INVALIDATE_RESETS, textual macroπMCOLOR_INVALIDATE_FORWARD indicates that after the user
modifies a buffer, any syntax highlighting information after the
modified region should be invalidated.
πMCOLOR_INVALIDATE_BACKWARD indicates that syntax
highlighting information before the modified region should be
invalidated.  πMCOLOR_INVALIDATE_RESETS tells Epsilon that
whenever it invalidates syntax highlighting in a region, it should
also set the color of all text in that region to the default of
-1.

For many languages, starting to color at an arbitrary place in the
buffer requires a lot of unnecessary work.  For example, the C
language has comments that can span many lines.  A coloring function
must know whether it's inside a comment before it can begin coloring.
Similarly, a coloring function that began looking from the third
character in the C identifier id37 might decide that it had seen
a numeric constant, and incorrectly color the buffer.

To simplify this problem, the coloring routines ensure that coloring
begins at a safe place.  We call a buffer position ªsafeº if the
code coloring function can color the buffer beginning at that point,
without looking at any earlier characters in the buffer.

When Epsilon calls the function in recolor_range, the value of
from is always safe.  Epsilon expects the function's return
value to be safe as well; it must be OK to continue coloring from
that point.  For C, this means the returned value must not lie inside
a comment, a keyword, or any other lexical unit.  Moreover, inside
the colored region, any boundary between characters set to different
color classes must be safe.  If the colored region contains a
keyword, for example, Epsilon assumes it can begin recoloring from
the start of that keyword.  (If this isn't true for a particular
language, its coloring function can examine the buffer itself to
determine where to begin coloring.)

recolor_from_herecolor_c_from_here() Vrecolor_from_here, variable Pcolor_c_from_here(), subroutineWhen Epsilon needs to color more of the buffer, it generally starts
from a known safe place: either a value returned by the buffer's
recolor_range function, or a boundary between characters of
different colors.  But when Epsilon first begins working on a part of
the buffer that hasn't been colored before, it must determine a safe
starting point.  The second function you must provide, stored in the
recolor_from_here buffer-specific function pointer, picks a
new starting point.  In C buffers, the recolor_from_here
function is named color_c_from_here( ).

The buffer's recolor_from_here function looks backward from
point for a safe position and returns it.  This may involve a search
back to the start of the buffer.  If Epsilon knows of a safe position
before point in the buffer, it passes this as the parameter
safe.  (If not, Epsilon passes 0, which is always safe.)
The function should respect the value of the ¬color-look-back≈color-look-back
variable to limit searching on slow machines.

recolor_by_lines()recolor_from_top() Precolor_by_lines(), subroutine Precolor_from_top(), subroutineEpsilon provides two standard recolor_from_here functions that
coloring extensions can use.  The recolor_by_lines( )
subroutine is good for buffers where coloring is line-based, such as
dired buffers.  In such buffers the coloring needed for a line
doesn't depend at all on the contents of previous lines.  The
recolor_from_top( ) subroutine has just the opposite effect;
it forces Epsilon to start from the beginning of the buffer (or an
already-colored place).  This may be all that's needed if a mode's
coloring function is very simple and quick.

Epsilon runs the code coloring functions while it's refreshing the
screen, so running the EEL debugger on code coloring functions is
difficult, since the debugger itself needs to refresh the screen.
The best way to debug such functions is to test them out by calling
them explicitly, using test-bed functions like these:

Ωcommand debug_color_region()≤{≤        fix_region();≤        set_character_color(point, mark, color_class default);≤        point = color_algol_range(point, mark);≤}≤æ≤
≤Ωcommand debug_from_here()≤{≤        point = color_algol_from_here(point);≤}≤æ≤
The first command above tries to recolor the current region, and
moves past the region it actually colored.  It begins by marking the
region with a distinctive color (using the default color class), to
help catch missing coloring.  The second command helps you test your
from_here function.  It moves point backwards to the nearest safe
position.  Once you're satisfied that your new code-coloring
functions work correctly, you can then set the recolor_range
and recolor_from_here variables to refer to them.

Ωwhen_displaying Vwhen_displaying, variablebuffer int (*when_displaying)();≤recolor_partial_code(int from, int to)≤char first_window_refresh;≤drop_all_colored_regions()≤drop_coloring(int buf)≤æ≤
Epsilon calls the EEL subroutine pointed to by the buffer-specific
function pointer when_displaying as it displays a window on
the screen.  It calls this subroutine once for each window, after
determining which part of the buffer will be displayed, but before
putting text for that window on the screen.

Epsilon sets the first_window_refresh≈first_window_refresh variable prior to
calling the when_displaying subroutine to indicate whether or
not this is the first time a particular buffer has been displayed
during a particular screen refresh.  When a buffer appears in more
than one window, Epsilon sets this variable to 1 before calling the
when_displaying subroutine during the display of the first
window, and sets it to zero before calling that subroutine during the
display of the remaining windows.  Epsilon sets the variable to
1 if the buffer only appears in one window.  The value is valid
only during a call to the buffer's when_displaying subroutine.

recolor_partial_code() Precolor_partial_code(), subroutineIn a buffer with code coloring turned on, the when_displaying
variable points to a subroutine named recolor_partial_code( ).
Epsilon passes two values to the subroutine that specify the range of
the buffer that was modified since the last time the buffer was
displayed.  The standard recolor_partial_code( ) subroutine
provided with Epsilon uses this information to discard any saved
coloring data for the modified region of the buffer in the data
structures it maintains.  It then calls the two language-specific
subroutines described at the beginning of this section as needed to
color parts of the buffer.

drop_all_colored_regions()drop_coloring() Pdrop_all_colored_regions(), subroutine Pdrop_coloring(), subroutineThe drop_all_colored_regions( ) subroutine discards coloring
information collected for the current buffer.  The next time Epsilon
needs to display the buffer, it will begin coloring the buffer again.
The drop_coloring( ) subroutine is similar, but lets you
specify the buffer number.  It also discards some data structures, so
it's more suitable when the buffer is about to be deleted.

Epsilon stores color choices in ªcolor schemeº
variables.  A color scheme specifies the color combination to use for
each defined color class.

Epsilon's standard color schemes are defined in the file stdcolor.e.
See Rcolorschemeπcolorscheme for the syntax of color definitions.
You can also create additional color schemes without loading an EEL
file by using the new_variable( ) primitive, providing
πMNT_COLSCHEME as the second parameter.  Epsilon stores color
schemes in its name table, just like variables and commands, so a
color scheme may not have the same name as a variable or other name
table entry.  (Color classes, on the other hand, have their own
unique "name space".)

table index of the color scheme to use.  Setting it changes the
current color scheme.  Each time Epsilon starts up, it sets this
variable from one of four other variables: _our_gui_scheme
under Epsilon for Windows or in Epsilon for Unix under X,
_our_unixconsole_scheme if Epsilon for Unix is running in
an xterm, _our_mono_scheme if Epsilon is running on a
monochrome display, or _our_color_scheme otherwise.  When
you use set-color to select a different color scheme, Epsilon
sets one of these variables, as well as selected_color_scheme.
The get_color_scheme_variable( ) subroutine returns a
pointer to one of these variables, the one containing a color scheme
index that's appropriate for the current environment.  By default,
these four variables refer to the color schemes
standard-gui, xterm-color, standard-mono and
standard-color, respectively.

If the window-specific variable window_color_scheme is non-zero
in a window, Epsilon uses its value in place of the
selected_color_scheme variable when displaying that window.
Epsilon uses this when displaying borderless windows, so that each
window has an entirely different set of color class settings.  Also
see the variable text_color.

Ωuser char monochrome;≤æ≤
The monochrome≈monochrome variable is nonzero if Epsilon believes it is
running on a monochrome display.  Epsilon tries to determine this
automatically, but the -vmono and -vcolor flags override
this.  See Rmonoπmono.

Ωset_color_pair()get_foreground_color()get_background_color() Pset_color_pair(), primitive Pget_foreground_color(), primitive Pget_background_color(), primitiveset_color_pair(int colorclass, int foreground, int background)≤int get_foreground_color(int colorclass, ?int raw)≤int get_background_color(int colorclass, ?int raw)≤æ≤
The set_color_pair( ) primitive lets you set the colors to
use for a particular color class within the current color scheme.
The first parameter is a color_class expression (see Rcolorclasssyntaxπcolor-class-syntax); the remaining parameters are 32-bit
numbers that specify the precise color to use.  Use the
πMMAKE_RGB( ) macro to construct suitable numbers.  See Rcolorschemeπcolorscheme.

The get_foreground_color( ) and
get_background_color( ) primitives let you retrieve the
colors specified for a given color class.  Normally they return a
specific foreground or background color, after Epsilon has applied
its rules for defaulting color specifications.  (See Rcolorschemeπcolorscheme.)  Specify a nonzero raw parameter, and
Epsilon will return the color class's actual setting.  It may include
one of the bits πMETRANSPARENT, πMECOLOR_COPY, or
πMECOLOR_UNKNOWN.

METRANSPARENT PETRANSPARENT, textual macroThe ETRANSPARENT macro is a special code that may be used
in place of a background color.  It tells Epsilon to substitute the
background color of the "text" color class in the current color
scheme.  You can also use it for a foreground color, and Epsilon will
substitute the foreground color of the "text" color class.

MECOLOR_UNKNOWN PECOLOR_UNKNOWN, textual macroThe ECOLOR_UNKNOWN macro in a foreground color indicates
there's no color information in the current scheme for the specified
color class.

MECOLOR_COPYMCOLOR_STRIP_ATTR() PECOLOR_COPY, textual macro PCOLOR_STRIP_ATTR(), textual macroThe ECOLOR_COPY macro in a foreground color tells Epsilon
that one color class is to borrow the settings of another.  The index
of other color class replaces the color in the lower bits of the
value; use the COLOR_STRIP_ATTR() macro to extract it.

When Epsilon looks up the foreground and background settings of a
color class, it uses this algorithm.

First it checks if the foreground color contains the
ECOLOR_UNKNOWN code.  If so, it tries to retrieve first a
class-specific default, and then a scheme-specific default.  First it
looks for that color class in the "color-defaults" color scheme.
This scheme is where Epsilon records all color class specifications
that are declared outside any particular color scheme.  If a
particular color pair is specified as a default for that class,
Epsilon uses that.  If the color class has no default, Epsilon
switches to the color class named "default" in the original color
scheme and repeats the process.

Either the default setting for the color class or the original
setting for the color class may use the ECOLOR_COPY macro.  If
so, then Epsilon switches to the indicated color class and repeats
the above process.  In the event that it detects a loop of color
class cross-references or otherwise can't resolve the colors, it
picks default colors.

Finally, if the resulting foreground or background colors use the
ETRANSPARENT bit, Epsilon substitutes the from the "text"
color class.

Ωalter_color() Palter_color(), primitiveint alter_color(int colorclass, int color)≤int rgb_to_attr(int rgb)≤int attr_to_rgb(int attr)≤æ≤
The alter_color( ) primitive is an older way to set colors.
When the argument color is -1, Epsilon simply returns the
color value for the specified color class.  Any other value makes the
color class use that color.  Epsilon then returns the previous color
for that color class.  (In Epsilon for Windows or under the X
windowing system, this function will return color codes, but ignores
attempts to set colors.  Use set_color_pair( ) to do this.)

The colors themselves (the second parameter to alter_color( ))
are specified numerically.  Each number contains a foreground color,
a background color, and an indication of whether blinking or
extra-bright characters are desired.

The alter_color( ) function uses 4-bit color attributes to
represent colors, the same as DOS and OS/2 text mode do.  The
foreground color is stored in the low-order 4 bits of the 8-bit color
attribute, and the background color is in the high-order 4 bits.
Epsilon uses a pair of 32-bit numbers to represent colors internally,
so alter_color( ) converts between the two representations as
needed.

rgb_to_attr()attr_to_rgb() Prgb_to_attr(), primitive Pattr_to_rgb(), primitiveThe functions rgb_to_attr( ) and attr_to_rgb( ) can
be used to perform the same conversion.  The rgb_to_attr( )
function takes a 32-bit RGB value and finds the nearest 4-bit
attribute, using Epsilon's simple internal rules, while
attr_to_rgb( ) converts in the other direction.

Ωorig_screen_color() Porig_screen_color(), primitiveint orig_screen_color()≤æ≤
Under DOS, Epsilon records the original color attribute of the screen
before writing text to it.  The orig_screen_color( ) primitive
returns this color code.  If the ¬restore-color-on-exit≈restore-color-on-exit
variable is nonzero, Epsilon sets the color class it uses after you
exit (color_class after_exiting) to this color.  See Rsetcolorπset-color.

Ωnumber_of_color_classes()name_color_class()color class Pnumber_of_color_classes(), primitive Pname_color_class(), primitivetext color classhoriz_border color classvert_border color classmode_line color classtext color classpopup_border color classint number_of_color_classes()≤char *name_color_class(int colclass)≤æ≤

The number_of_color_classes( ) primitive
returns the number of defined color classes.  The
name_color_class( ) primitive takes the numeric code of a color
class (numbered from 0 to number_of_color_classes() - 1)
and gives the name.  For example, if the expression color_class
mode_line has the value 3, then the expression
name_color_class(3) gives the string "mode-line".

popup_title color classEach window on the screen can use different color classes for its
text, its borders, and its titles (if any).  When a normal, tiled
window is created, Epsilon sets its color selections from the color
classes named text, horiz_border,
vert_border, and mode_line.  When Epsilon creates a
pop-up window, it sets the window's color selections from the color
classes text, popup_border, and
popup_title.  See Rsetcolorπset-color for a description
of the other predefined color classes.

Ωuser window int text_color;≤æ≤
The text_color≈text_color primitive contains the color class of normal
text in the current window.  You can get and set the other color
classes for a window using the functions get_wattrib( ) and
set_wattrib( ).

2File Primitives
3File Reading Primitives

 PFILETYPE_AUTO, textual macro Pfile_read(), primitivefile_read()RfileioΩint file_read(char *file, int transl)≤æ≤

The file_read( ) primitive reads the named file into the
current buffer, replacing the text that was there.  It returns an
error code if an error occurred, or 0 if the read was successful.
The transl parameter specifies the line translation to be done on
the file.  The buffer's ¬translation-type≈translation-type variable will be set
to its value.  If transl is πMFILETYPE_AUTO, Epsilon will
examine the file as it's read and set ¬translation-type≈translation-type to an
appropriate translation type.

Ωnew_file_read() Pnew_file_read(), primitiveint new_file_read(char *name, int transl,≤                  struct file_info *f_info,≤                  int start, int max)≤æ≤
The new_file_read( ) primitive reads a file like
file_read( ) but provides more options.  The f_info
parameter is a pointer to a structure, which Epsilon fills in with
information on the file's write date, file type, and so forth.  The
structure has the same format as the check_file( ) primitive
uses (see Rcheckfileπcheckfile).  If the f_info
parameter is null, Epsilon doesn't get such information.

When Epsilon reads the file, it starts at offset start and reads
at most max characters.  You can use this to read only part of a
big file.  If start or max are negative, they are
(individually) ignored: Epsilon starts at the beginning, or reads the
whole file, respectively.  The start parameter refers to the
file before Epsilon strips ⁄Return€'s, while max counts the
characters after stripping.

Ωdo_file_read()_read_aborted Pdo_file_read(), subroutine V_read_aborted, variableint do_file_read(char *s, int transl)  /* files.e */≤buffer char _read_aborted;≤int read_file(char *file, int transl)  /* files.e */≤int find_remote_file(char *file, int transl)≤file_convert_read()≤do_readonly_warning()≤update_readonly_warning(struct file_info *p)≤æ≤
Instead of calling the above primitives directly, extensions
typically call one of several subroutines, all defined in files.e,
that do things beyond simply reading in the file.  Each takes the
same two parameters as file_read( ), and returns either 0 or
an error code.

find_remote_file()file_convert_read() Pfind_remote_file(), subroutine Pfile_convert_read(), subroutineThe do_file_read( ) subroutine records the file's date and
time, so Epsilon can later warn the user that a file's been modified
on disk, if necessary.  If the user aborted reading the file,
do_file_read( ) sets the _read_aborted variable
nonzero.  Epsilon then warns the user if he tries to save the partial
file.  This subroutine also handles reading URL's by calling the
find_remote_file( ) subroutine, and character set
translations such as OEM translations (see Rfileioconvertπfile-io-convert) by calling file_convert_read( ).

read_file()do_readonly_warning()update_readonly_warning() Pread_file(), subroutine Pdo_readonly_warning(), subroutine Pupdate_readonly_warning(), subroutineThe read_file( ) subroutine calls do_file_read( ), then
displays either an error message, if a read error occurred, or the
message "New file."  It also handles calling
do_readonly_warning( ) when it detects a read-only file, or
update_readonly_warning( ) otherwise.  (The latter can turn
off a buffer's read-only attribute, if the file is no longer
read-only.)

Ωfind_in_other_buf()call_mode() Pfind_in_other_buf(), subroutine Pcall_mode(), subroutineint find_in_other_buf(char *file, int transl)  /* files.e */≤call_mode(char *file)                 /* files.e */≤æ≤
The find_in_other_buf( ) subroutine makes up a unique buffer
name for the file, based on its name, and then calls
read_file( ).  It then goes into the appropriate mode for the
file, based on the file's extension, by calling the
call_mode( ) subroutine.  (See Rsuffixπsuffix.)

Ωfind_it()look_file() Pfind_it(), subroutine Plook_file(), subroutineint find_it(char *fname, int transl)      /* files.e */≤int look_file(char *fname)                /* buffer.e */≤æ≤
The find_it( ) subroutine first looks in all existing buffers
for the named file, just as the ¬find-file command would.  If
it finds the file, it simply switches to that buffer.  (It also
checks the copy of the file on disk, and warns the user if it's been
modified.)  If the file isn't already in a buffer, it calls
find_in_other_buf( ), and returns 0 or its error code.
The find_it( ) subroutine uses the look_file( ) subroutine
to search through existing buffers for the file.  The
look_file( ) subroutine, defined in buffer.e, returns 0 if
no buffer has the file.  Otherwise, it returns 1 and switches to
the buffer by setting bufnum.

Ωdo_find() Pdo_find(), subroutineint do_find(char *file, int transl)            /* files.e */≤æ≤
Finally, the do_find( ) subroutine is at the top of this tree
of file-reading functions.  It checks to see if its "file name"
parameter is a directory.  If it is (or if it's a file pattern with
wildcard characters), it calls dired_one( ) to run dired on the
pattern.  If it's a normal file, do_find( ) calls find_it( ).

Ωerr_file_read() Perr_file_read(), subroutineint err_file_read(char *file, int transl)      /* files.e */≤æ≤
Use the err_file_read( ) subroutine when you want to read a
file that must exist, but you don't want all the extras that
higher-level functions provide: checking file dates, choosing a
buffer, setting up for read-only files, and so forth.  It calls
file_read( ) to read the file into the current buffer, and
displays an error message if the file couldn't be read for any
reason.  It returns the error code, or 0 if there were no errors.

3File Writing Primitives

 Pnew_file_write(), primitive Pfile_write(), primitivenew_file_write()file_write()Ωint file_write(char *file, int transl)≤æ≤
The file_write( ) primitive attempts to write the current
buffer to the named file.  It returns 0 if the write was
successful, or an error code if an error occurred.  The transl
parameter specifies the line translation to be done while writing the
file.  See the description of ¬translation-type≈translation-type below.

Ωint new_file_write(char *name, int transl,≤                   struct file_info *f_info,≤                   int start, int max)≤æ≤
The new_file_write( ) primitive writes a file, like
file_write( ), but provides more options.  The f_info
parameter is a pointer to a structure, which Epsilon fills in with
information on the file's write date, file type, and so forth, just
after it finishes writing the file.  The structure has the same
format as the check_file( ) primitive uses (see Rcheckfileπcheckfile).  If the f_info parameter is null, Epsilon
doesn't get such information.

If start is negative (the usual case), the file will wind up
with only what Epsilon writes to it.  Otherwise, Epsilon only
rewrites a section of it, and the rest will not change.  Epsilon
begins writing at offset start in the file.  If the max
parameter is non-negative, Epsilon writes only the specified number
of characters.  (Epsilon counts the characters before adding any
⁄Return€ characters.)

Ωdo_save_file() Pdo_save_file(), subroutineint do_save_file(int backup, int checkdate, int getdate) /* files.e */≤æ≤
The do_save_file( ) subroutine saves the current buffer like
the save-file command, but lets you skip some of the things
save-file does.  Set the backup parameter to 0 if
you don't want a backup file created, even if want-backups is
nonzero.  Set checkdate to 0 if you don't want Epsilon to
check that the file on disk is unchanged since it was read.  Set
getdate to 0 if you don't want Epsilon to update its notion
of the file's date, after the file has been written.

The function returns 0 if the write was successful, 1 if an
error occurred, or 2 if the function asked the user to confirm a
questionable write, and the user decided not to write the file after
all.

ΩRfile-io-convertfile_convert_write()save_remote_file() Pfile_convert_write(), subroutine Psave_remote_file(), subroutineint file_convert_write(char *file, int trans,≤                       struct file_info *f_info)≤int save_remote_file(char *fname, int trans,≤                     struct file_info *finfo)≤buffer char *(*file_io_converter)();≤char *oem_file_converter(int func)≤zeroed char *(*new_file_io_converter)();≤æ≤
The do_save_file( ) subroutine uses the
file_convert_write( ) subroutine to actually write the file.
Like new_file_write( ), it takes a file name, a line translation
code as described under ¬translation-type≈translation-type below, and a
structure which Epsilon will fill with information on the file's
write date, file type, and so forth.  See do_save_file( ) above
for details.

Unlike primitives such as new_file_write( ), the
file_convert_write( ) subroutine knows how to handle URL files
by calling the save_remote_file( ) subroutine.  It also
takes care of the translation needed for OEM files that were read via
the find-oem-file command.

file_io_converteroem_file_converter() Vfile_io_converter, variable Poem_file_converter(), subroutineThe OEM translation is handled by a facility that can also handle
other types of translation.  The file_convert_write( ) primitive
looks for a buffer-specific variable file_io_converter.
This variable can be null, for no special translation, or it can
contain a function pointer.  For OEM files, it points to the
subroutine oem_file_converter( ).

MFILE_CONVERT_READMFILE_CONVERT_WRITE PFILE_CONVERT_READ, textual macro PFILE_CONVERT_WRITE, textual macroAny such subroutine will be called with a code indicating the desired
action.  The codes are defined in eel.h.  The code
FILE_CONVERT_READ tells the subroutine to translate the
text in the current buffer as appropriate when reading a file.  The
code FILE_CONVERT_WRITE tells the subroutine to translate
the buffer as appropriate when writing a file.

MFILE_CONVERT_ASK PFILE_CONVERT_ASK, textual macroBefore actually performing a conversion, Epsilon will call the
subroutine to ask if the conversion is safe, by passing the
FILE_CONVERT_ASK in addition to one of the above flags.
The OEM converter uses this to see if the buffer contains any
characters without a unique translation, and asks the user to confirm
the conversion if so.  The converter should return a null pointer to
cancel the read or write operation, or any other value to let it
proceed.  When this flag isn't present, the subroutine should return
the name of its minor mode--Epsilon will display this in the mode
line.  The OEM converter returns " OEM".

new_file_io_converter Vnew_file_io_converter, variableWhen creating a new buffer, file-reading subroutines initialize the
file_io_converter variable by copying the value of
new_file_io_converter.  Commands like find-oem-file
temporarily set this variable to effect reading a file with OEM
translation.

Ωask_save_buffer()warn_existing_file() Pask_save_buffer(), subroutine Pwarn_existing_file(), subroutineint ask_save_buffer()≤int warn_existing_file(char *s)≤æ≤
A command can call the ask_save_buffer( ) subroutine before
deleting a buffer with unsaved changes.  It asks the user if the
buffer should be saved before it's deleted, and returns non-zero if
the user asked that the buffer be saved.  The caller is responsible
for actually saving the file.

Before writing to a user-specified file, a command may call the
warn_existing_file( ) subroutine.  This will check if the
file already exists and warn the user that it will be overwritten.
The subroutine returns zero if the file didn't exist, or if the user
said to go ahead and overwrite it, or nonzero if the user said not to
overwrite it.

3Line Translation Primitives

 PFILETYPE_BINARY, textual macrotranslationcarriage return translationline translationMFILETYPE_BINARYRstripreturnsΩMFILETYPE_MSDOS PFILETYPE_MSDOS, textual macrouser buffer int translation_type;       /* EEL variable */≤æ≤
Epsilon normally deals
with files with
lines separated by the ⁄Newline€ character.  Windows, DOS and
OS/2, however, generally separate one line from the next with a
⁄Return€ character followed by a ⁄Newline€ character.  For
this reason, Epsilon normally removes all ⁄Return€ characters
from a file when it's read from disk, and places a ⁄Return€
character before each ⁄Newline€ character when a buffer is
written to disk, in these environments.  But Epsilon has several
other line translation methods, specified by the buffer-specific
variable ¬translation-type≈translation-type.

The FILETYPE_BINARY translation type tells Epsilon not to
modify the file at all when reading or writing.

The FILETYPE_MSDOS translation type tells Epsilon to remove
⁄Return€ characters when reading a file, and insert a
⁄Return€ character before each ⁄Newline€ when writing a file.

MFILETYPE_UNIX PFILETYPE_UNIX, textual macro PFILETYPE_BINARY, textual macroThe FILETYPE_UNIX translation type tells Epsilon not to
modify the file at all when reading or writing.  It's similar to
FILETYPE_BINARY (but Epsilon copies buffer text to the system

MFILETYPE_MAC PFILETYPE_MAC, textual macroThe FILETYPE_MAC translation type tells Epsilon to convert
⁄Return€ characters to ⁄Newline€ characters when reading a
file, and to convert ⁄Newline€ characters to ⁄Return€
characters when writing a file.

MFILETYPE_AUTO PFILETYPE_AUTO, textual macro PFILETYPE_AUTO, textual macro PFILETYPE_MSDOS, textual macro PFILETYPE_UNIX, textual macroThe FILETYPE_AUTO translation type tells Epsilon to examine
the contents of a file as it's read, and determine the proper
translation type using a heuristic.  Epsilon then reads the file
using that translation type, and sets ¬translation-type≈translation-type to the
new value.  Normally this value is only used when reading a file, not
when writing one.  If you try to write a file and specify a
translation type of FILETYPE_AUTO, it will behave the same as
FILETYPE_MSDOS (except in Epsilon for Unix, where it's the
same as FILETYPE_UNIX.

Most functions for reading or writing a file take one of the above
values as a transl parameter.

Ω PFILETYPE_AUTO, textual macro PFILETYPE_AUTO, textual macrouser short default_translation_type;≤user short new_buffer_translation_type;≤int ask_line_translate()≤æ≤
A user can set the ¬default-translation-type≈default-translation-type variable to one of
the above values to force Epsilon to use a specific translation when
it reads an existing file.  If this variable is set to its default
value of FILETYPE_AUTO, Epsilon examines the file to determine
a translation method, but setting this variable to any other value
forces Epsilon to use that line translation method for all files.

 PFILETYPE_UNIX, textual macro PFILETYPE_MSDOS, textual macroWhen Epsilon creates a new buffer, it sets the buffer's
translation-type variable to the value of the
¬new-buffer-translation-type≈new-buffer-translation-type variable.  Epsilon does the same
when you try to read a file that doesn't exist.  You can set this
variable if you want Epsilon to examine existing files to determine
their translation type, but create new files with a specific
translation type.  By default this variable is set to
FILETYPE_AUTO, so the type for new buffers becomes
FILETYPE_UNIX in Epsilon for Unix, and πMFILETYPE_MSDOS
elsewhere.

ask_line_translate() Pask_line_translate(), subroutineThe ask_line_translate( ) subroutine defined in files.e
helps to select the desired translation method.  Many commands that
read a user-specified file call it.  If a numeric prefix argument was
not specified, it returns the value of the
¬default-translation-type≈default-translation-type variable.  But if a numeric prefix
argument was specified, it prompts the user for the desired
translation type.

 Punsaved_buffers(), subroutineunsaved_buffers()Ωuser buffer short modified;≤int unsaved_buffers()≤int is_unsaved_buffer()≤int buffer_unchanged()≤æ≤
Epsilon maintains a variable that tells whether the buffer was
modified since it was last saved to a file.  The buffer-specific
variable modified≈modified is set to 1 each time the current buffer
is modified.  It is set to 0 by the file_read( ),
file_write( ), new_file_read( ), and new_file_write( )
primitives, if they complete without error.

is_unsaved_buffer() Pis_unsaved_buffer(), subroutineThe unsaved_buffers( ) subroutine defined in files.e returns
1 if there are any modified buffers.  It doesn't count empty
buffers, or those with no associated file names.  If an EEL program
creates a buffer that has an associated file name and is marked
modified, but still doesn't require saving, it can set the
buffer-specific variable ¬discardable_buffer≈discardable_buffer nonzero to
indicate that the current buffer doesn't require any such warning.
The unsaved_buffers( ) subroutine calls the
is_unsaved_buffer( ) subroutine to check on an individual
buffer.  It tells if the current buffer shouldn't be deleted, and
checks for the discardable_buffer variable as well as the
¬buffer-not-saveable≈buffer-not-saveable variable and other special kinds of
buffers.

buffer_unchanged() Pbuffer_unchanged(), primitiveThe buffer_unchanged( ) primitive returns a nonzero value if
the current buffer has been modified since the last call of the
refresh( ) or maybe_refresh( ) primitives.  It returns zero
if the buffer has not changed since that time.  Epsilon calls
maybe_refresh( ) to display the screen after each command.

Ωset_buffer_filename() Pset_buffer_filename(), subroutineuser buffer char *filename;≤set_buffer_filename(char *file)≤æ≤
The file reading and writing functions are normally used with the
file name associated with each buffer, which is stored in the
buffer-specific filename≈filename variable.  To set this variable, use
the syntax filename = »new value…;.  Don't use
strcpy( ), for example, to modify it.

The set_buffer_filename( ) subroutine defined in files.e
sets the file name associated with the current buffer.  However,
unlike simply setting the primitive variable filename to the
desired value, this function also modifies the current buffer's name
to match the new file name, takes care of making sure the file name
is in absolute form, and updates the buffer's access "timestamp".
The bufed command uses this timestamp to display buffers
sorted by access time.

Ωfile_error() Pfile_error(), primitiveuser int errno;≤file_error(int code, char *file, char *unknown)≤æ≤
File primitives that fail often place an error code in the
errno variable.  The file_error( ) primitive takes an
error code and a file name and displays to the user a textual version
of the error message.  It also takes a message to print if the error
code is unknown.

Ωdo_insert_file()write_part() Pdo_insert_file(), subroutine Pwrite_part(), subroutineint do_insert_file(char *file, int transl) /* files.e */≤int write_part(char *file, int transl, int start, int end)≤æ≤
The do_insert_file( ) subroutine inserts a file into the
current buffer, like the ¬insert-file command.  The
write_part( ) subroutine writes only part of the current buffer
to a file.  Each displays an error message if the file could not be
read or written, and returns either an error code or 0.

Ωlocate_window()buf_in_window() Plocate_window(), subroutine Pbuf_in_window(), primitivelocate_window(char *buf, char *file)  /* buffer.e */≤int buf_in_window(int bnum)≤æ≤
The locate_window( ) subroutine defined in window.e tries to
display a given file or buffer by changing windows.  If either of the
arguments is an empty string "" it will be ignored.  If a buffer with
the specified name or a buffer displaying the specified file is shown
in a window, the subroutine switches to that window.  Otherwise, it
makes the current window show the indicated buffer, if any.

The buf_in_window( ) primitive finds a window that displays a
given buffer, and returns its window handle.  It returns -1 if no
window displays that buffer.

Ωdelete_file() Pdelete_file(), primitiveint delete_file(char *file)≤æ≤
The delete_file( ) primitive deletes a file.  It returns
0 if the deletion succeeded, and -1 if it failed.  The
errno≈errno variable has a code describing the error in the latter
case.

Ωrename_file() Prename_file(), primitiveint rename_file(char *oldfile, char *newfile)≤æ≤
The rename_file( ) primitive changes a file's name.  It returns
zero if the file was successfully renamed, and nonzero otherwise.  The
errno≈errno variable has a code describing the error in the latter
case.  You can use this primitive to rename a file to a different
directory, but you cannot use it to move a file to a different disk.

Ωcopyfile() Pcopyfile(), primitiveint copyfile(char *oldfile, char *newfile)≤æ≤
The copyfile( ) primitive makes a copy of the file named
oldfile, giving it the name newfile, without reading the
entire file into memory at once.  The copy has the same time and date
as the original.  The primitive returns zero if it succeeds.  If it
fails to copy the file, it returns a nonzero value and sets
errno to indicate the error.

Ωmake_backup() Pmake_backup(), primitiveint make_backup(char *file, char *backupname)≤æ≤
The make_backup( ) primitive does whatever is necessary to make
a backup of a file.  It takes the name of the original file and the
name of the desired backup file, and returns 0 if the backup was
made.  Otherwise, it puts an error code in errno and returns a
nonzero number.  The primitive may simply rename the file, if this
can be accomplished without losing any special attributes or
permissions the original file has.  If necessary, Epsilon copies the
original file to its backup file.

Ωmake_temp_file() Pmake_temp_file(), primitivemake_temp_file(char *file, int freespace)≤æ≤
The make_temp_file( ) primitive creates a temporary file.
Epsilon uses the same algorithm here as it does when creating its own
temporary files, checking the free space of each directory listed in
the swap path looking for one with at least freespace bytes
available.  Once it has selected the directory, Epsilon makes sure it
can create a file with the chosen name, aborting with an error
message if it cannot.  Epsilon then copies the name it has chosen for
the temporary file into the character array file.

Ωget_file_read_only()set_file_read_only()set_file_opsys_attribute()read-only files Pget_file_read_only(), primitive Pset_file_read_only(), primitive Pset_file_opsys_attribute(), primitiveint get_file_read_only(char *fname)≤int set_file_read_only(char *fname, int val)≤int set_file_opsys_attribute(char *fname, int attribute)≤æ≤
The get_file_read_only( ) primitive
returns 1 if the file fname has been set read-only, 0 if
it's writable, or -1 if the file's read-only status can't be
determined (perhaps because the file doesn't exist).  The
set_file_read_only( ) primitive sets the file fname
read-only (if val is nonzero) or writable (if val is zero).
It returns 0 if an error occurred, otherwise nonzero.

Under Unix, set_file_read_only( ) sets the file writable for the
current user, group and others, as modified by the current umask
setting (as if you'd just created the file).  Other permission bits
aren't modified.

The set_file_opsys_attribute( ) primitive sets the raw
attribute of a file.  The precise meaning of the attribute depends on
the operating system: under Unix this sets the file's permission
bits, while in other environments it can set such attributes as
Hidden or System.  The primitive returns nonzero if it succeeds.  See
the opsysattr member of the structure set by check_file( ) to
retrieve the raw attribute of a file.

Ωis_directory()is_pattern() Pis_directory(), primitive Pis_pattern(), primitiveint is_directory(char *str)≤int is_pattern(char *str)≤æ≤
The is_directory( ) primitive takes a string, and asks the
operating system if a directory by that name exists.  If so,
is_directory( ) returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.  Also
see the check_file( ) primitive in Rcheckfileπcheckfile, and
the is_remote_dir( ) subroutine in Risremotedirπis-remote-dir.

The is_pattern( ) primitive takes a string, and tells
whether it forms a file pattern with wildcards that may match several
files.  It returns 2 if its file name argument contains the
characters * or ?.  These characters are always wildcard
characters and never part of a legal file name.  The function returns
1 if its file name argument contains any of the following
characters: left square-bracket, left curly-bracket, comma, or
semicolon.  These characters can sometimes be part of a valid file
name (depending upon the operating system and file system in use),
but are also used as file pattern characters in Epsilon.  It returns
3 if the file name contains both types of characters, and it returns
0 if the file name contains none of these characters.

The check_file( ) primitive gets
miscellaneous information on a file or subdirectory from the
operating system.  It returns codes defined by macros in codes.h.  If
its argument file denotes a pattern that may match multiple
files, it returns CHECK_PATTERN.  (Use the
file_match( ) primitive described in Rfilematchπfilematch to
retrieve the matches.)  If file names a directory or a file, it
returns CHECK_DIR or CHECK_FILE, respectively.
If file names a device, it returns CHECK_DEVICE.  Under
operating systems that support it, check_file( ) returns
CHECK_PIPE for a named pipe and CHECK_OTHER for
an unrecognized special file.  Otherwise, it returns 0.  If
f_info has a non-null value, check_file( )≈check_file() fills the
structure it points to with information on the file or directory.
The structure has the following format (defined in eel.h):

ΩMATTR_READONLYMATTR_DIRECTORY PATTR_READONLY, textual macro PATTR_DIRECTORY, textual macrostruct file_info {      /* returned by check_file() */≤        int fsize;      /* file size in bytes */≤        short year;     /* file date: 1980-2099 */≤        short month;    /* 1-12 */≤        short day;      /* 1-31 */≤        short hour;     /* 0-23 */≤        short minute;   /* 0-59 */≤        short second;   /* 0-59 */≤        short opsysattr; /* system dependent attribute */≤        char attr;      /* epsilon standardized attribute */≤        char check_type; /* file/directory/device code */≤};≤#define ATTR_READONLY   1≤#define ATTR_DIRECTORY  2≤æ≤
The check_type member contains the same value as
check_file( )'s return code.  The attr member contains two
flags: ATTR_READONLY if the file cannot be written, or
ATTR_DIRECTORY if the operating system says the file is
actually a directory.  The opsysattr member contains a raw
attribute code from the operating system: the meaning of bits here
depends on the operating system, and Epsilon doesn't interpret them.
(See the set_file_opsys_attribute( ) primitive to set raw
attribute codes for a file.)

For the second parameter to check_file( ), make sure you provide
a ªpointerº to a struct file_info, not the actual structure
itself.  You can omit this parameter entirely if you only want the
function's return value.

Ωcompare_dates()format_date() Pcompare_dates(), subroutine Pformat_date(), subroutineint compare_dates(struct file_info *a,≤                  struct file_info *b)≤format_date(char *msg, int year, int month,≤            int day, int hour, int minute,≤            int second)≤æ≤
The compare_dates( ) subroutine defined in filedate.e can be
used to compare the dates in two file_info structures.  It
returns 0 if they have the same date and time, a negative number
if a is dated earlier than b, or positive if a is
dated later than b.

The format_date( ) subroutine takes a date and converts it
to text form.

Ωcheck_dates() Pcheck_dates(), subroutineint check_dates(int save)               /* filedate.e */≤æ≤
The check_dates( ) subroutine defined in filedate.e compares
a file's time and date on disk with the date saved when the file was
last read or written.  If the file on disk has a later date, it warns
the user and asks what to do.  Its parameter should be nonzero if
Epsilon was about to save the file, otherwise zero.  The function
returns nonzero if the user said not to save the file.

The following example command uses check_file( ) to display the
current file name and its date in the echo area.

3Low-level File Primitives

 Plowread(), primitive Plowopen(), primitivelowread()lowopen()Ωint lowopen(char *file, int mode)≤æ≤
The following primitives provide low-level access to files.  The
lowopen( ) primitive takes the name of a file and a mode code.
It returns a "file handle" for use with the other primitives.  The
mode may be 0 for reading only, 1 for writing only, or
2 for both.  If the file doesn't exist already, the primitive
will return an error, unless you use mode 3.  Mode 3 creates or
empties the file first, and permits reading and writing.

Ωlowwrite() Plowwrite(), primitiveint lowread(int handle, char *buffer, int count)≤int lowwrite(int handle, char *buffer, int count)≤æ≤
The lowread( ) primitive tries to read the specified number of
characters, putting them in the character array buffer, and
returns the number of characters it was able to read.  A value of 0
indicates the file has ended.  The lowwrite( ) primitive is
similar.  A return value different from count may indicate that
the disk is full.

Ωlowseek()lowclose() Plowseek(), primitive Plowclose(), primitiveint lowseek(int handle, int offset, int mode)≤int lowclose(int handle)≤æ≤
The lowseek( ) primitive repositions within the file.  If the
mode is 0, it positions to the offsetth character in the
file, if 1 to the offsetth character from the previous
position, and if 2 to the offsetth character from the end.
The primitive returns the new offset within the file.
Finally, the lowclose( ) primitive closes the file.  All these
routines return -1 if an error occurred and set errno with
its code.

3Directories

 Pchdir(), primitive Pgetcd(), primitivechdir()getcd()Ωint getcd(char *dir)≤int chdir(char *dir)≤æ≤
The getcd( ) primitive returns the current directory,
placing it in the provided string.  The format is
B:¥harold¥work.

The chdir( ) primitive sets the current directory.  (It sets
the current drive as well if its argument refers to a drive.  For
example, invoking chdir("A:¥letters"); sets the current
drive to A, then sets the current directory for drive A to
¥letters.  chdir("A:"); sets only the current drive.)  The
result for this primitive is 0 if the attempt succeeded, and
-1 if it failed.  The errno≈errno variable is set with a code
showing the type of error in the latter case.

Ωput_directory()get_buffer_directory() Pput_directory(), subroutine Pget_buffer_directory(), subroutineput_directory(char *dir)   /* files.e subr. */≤int get_buffer_directory(char *dir)≤æ≤
The put_directory( ) subroutine copies the directory part of
the file name associated with the current buffer into dir.
Normally the directory name will end with a path separator character
like "/" or "¥".  If the current buffer has no associated file
name, dir will be set to the empty string.

The get_buffer_directory( ) subroutine gets the default
directory for the current buffer in dir.  In most cases this is
the directory part of the buffer's filename variable, but
special buffers like dired buffers have their own rules.  The
subroutine returns nonzero if the buffer had an associated directory.
If the buffer has no associated directory, the subroutine puts
Epsilon's current directory in dir and returns 0.

Ωuser char *process_current_directory;≤æ≤
Epsilon stores the concurrent process's current directory in the
process_current_directory≈process_current_directory variable.  Setting this variable
switches the concurrent process to a different current directory.  To
set this variable, use the syntax process_current_directory = new
value;.  Don't use strcpy(), for example, to modify it.

The Windows 95/98 (or 3.1) versions of Epsilon only transmit current
directory information to or from the process when the process stops
for console input.  The DOS version transmits current directory
information immediately.  Epsilon for OS/2 doesn't transmit this
information, and a subprocess's current directory isn't accessible
from Epsilon.  Under Unix, Epsilon tries to retrieve the process's
current directory whenever you access this variable, but setting it
has no effect.  Under NT, Epsilon tries to detect the process's
current directory using a different method and doesn't use this
variable.

When the variable ¬use-process-current-directory≈use-process-current-directory is 1, the
default, Epsilon and the subprocess use the same current directory.
In this case, setting this variable is equivalent to changing the
current directory.

Ωmkdir()rmdir() Pmkdir(), primitive Prmdir(), primitiveint mkdir(char *dir)≤int rmdir(char *dir)≤æ≤
The mkdir( ) subroutine makes a new directory with the given
name, and the rmdir( ) subroutine removes an empty directory
with the given name.  Each primitive returns 0 on success and
-1 on failure, and sets errno≈errno in the latter case, as with
chdir( )≈chdir().

The dired_one( ) subroutine takes a file
name pattern as its argument and acts just like the ¬dired
command does, making a dired buffer, filling it and putting it in
dired mode.  It puts its pattern in a standard form and chooses a
suitable buffer name, then calls the create_dired_listing( )
subroutine.  This function prepares the buffer and displays suitable
messages, then calls make_dired( ).

The make_dired( ) subroutine handles FTP dired requests by
calling do_remote_dired( ), and passes local dired requests
to the do_dired( ) primitive to fill the buffer with
directory information.

Each of these routines takes a file name with wildcard characters
such as * and ?, and inserts in the current buffer exactly what the
¬dired command does (see Rdiredπdired).  Each returns
0 normally, and 1 if there were no matches.

By default, the do_dired( ) primitive ignores the abort key.  To
permit aborting a long file match, set the primitive variable
abort_file_matching≈abort_file_matching using save_var to tell Epsilon what to
do when the user presses the abort key.  See Rabortfilematchingπabort-file-matching for details.

is_dired_buf() Pis_dired_buf(), subroutineThe is_dired_buf( ) subroutine returns
1 if the current buffer is a dired buffer, otherwise 0.

Sometimes there are several interchangeable ways to write a
particular file pattern.  For example, /dir1/dir2/* always makes
the same list of files as /dir1/dir2/ or /dir1/dir2.  The
dired_standardize( ) primitive converts a dired pattern to its
simplest form, in place.  In the example, the last pattern is
considered the simplest form.

The standardize_remote_pathname( ) subroutine is similar,
but operates on FTP URL's.  It calls several other subroutines to
help.

The remote_dirname_absolute( ) subroutine converts a
relative remote pathname to an absolute one in place.  It performs an
FTP operation to get the user's home directory, then inserts it into
the given pathname.

drop_dots() Pdrop_dots(), subroutineThe drop_dots( ) subroutine removes . and interprets
.. in a pathname, modifying it in place.  It removes any ..
components at the start of a path.

Ωdetect_dired_format() Pdetect_dired_format(), subroutinedetect_dired_format()≤zeroed buffer char dired_format;≤#define DF_UNIX     1≤#define DF_SIMPLE   2≤#define DF_OLDNT    3≤#define DF_VMS      4≤int get_dired_item(char *prefix, int func)≤æ≤
The dired command supports several different formats for
directory listings.  Besides the standard format it uses for local
directory listings, as generated by the do_dired( ) primitive, it
understands the directory listings generated by FTP servers that run
on Unix systems (and the many servers on other operating systems that
use the same format), as well as several others.

The detect_dired_format( ) subroutine determines the proper
format by scanning a dired buffer, and sets the ¬dired_format≈dired_format
variable as appropriate.  A value of 0 indicates the default,
local directory format.  The other values represent other formats.

get_dired_item() Pget_dired_item(), subroutineVarious subroutines in dired use the get_dired_item( )
subroutine to help locate format-specific functions or variables, to
do tasks that depend on the particular format.  The subroutine takes
a prefix like "dired-isdir-" and looks for a function named
dired_isdir_unix() (assuming the dired_format variable
indicates Unix).  It returns the name table index of the function it
found, if there is one, or zero otherwise.

If its parameter func is nonzero, it looks only for functions; if
zero, it looks only for variables.  You can use an expression like
(* (int (*)()) i)() to call the function (assuming i is the
value returned by get_dired_item( )), or an expression like
get_str_var(i) to get the value of a variable given its index.

Because the current directory can change (either through use of the
chdir( )≈chdir() primitive described above, or, under DOS or Windows,
because another process has changed the directory), Epsilon normally
keeps file names in absolute pathname form, with all the defaults in
the name made explicit.  It converts a file name to the appropriate
relative pathname whenever it displays the name (for example, in the
mode line).

The absolute( ) primitive takes a pointer to a character array
containing a file name.  It makes the file name be an absolute
pathname, with all the defaults made explicit.  For example, if the
default drive is B:, the current directory is
/harold/papers, the path_sep≈path_sep variable is "¥" and
the 80 character array fname contains "proposal"; calling
absolute( ) with the argument fname makes fname contain
"B:¥harold¥papers¥proposal".

relative() Prelative(), primitiveThe primitive relative( ) does the reverse.  It takes a file
name in absolute form and puts an equivalent relative file name in a
character array.  Unlike absolute( ), which modifies its
argument in place, relative( ) makes a copy of the argument
with the changes.  If the default drive is B:, the
current directory is ¥harold and the 80 character array abs
contains B:¥harold¥papers¥proposal, calling
relative(abs, rel); puts "papers¥proposal" in the string
array rel.  You can also get a relative file name by using the
%r format specifier in any Epsilon primitive that accepts a
printf-style format string.

The relative( ) and absolute( ) primitives each take an
optional additional argument, which names a directory.  The
absolute( ) primitive assumes that any relative file names in
its first argument are relative to the directory named by the second
argument.  (If the second argument is missing or null, the primitive
assumes that relative file names are relative to the current
directory.)  Similarly, if you provide a third argument to the
relative( ) primitive, it makes file names relative to the
specified directory, instead of the current directory.

Note that in EEL string or character constants, the ¥ character begins an escape sequence, and you must double it if the
character ¥ is to appear in a string.  Thus the DOS file
name ¥harold¥papers must appear in an EEL program
as the string "¥¥harold¥¥papers".

Ωget_tail() Pget_tail(), primitivechar *get_tail(char *file, ?int dirok)≤æ≤
The get_tail( ) primitive takes a string containing a file name
and returns a pointer to a position in the string after the name of the
last directory.  For example, suppose that file is the string
"/harold/papers/proposal".  Then

Ωget_tail(file, 0)æ

would return a pointer to "proposal".
Since the pointer returned is to the original string, you can use this
primitive to modify that string.  Using the above example, a
subsequent

Ωstrcpy(get_tail(file, 0), "sample");æ

would make file contain the string
"/harold/papers/sample". The dirok argument says what to do
with a file name ending with a separator character "¥" or "/".
If dirok is nonzero the primitive returns a pointer to right
after the final separator character.  If dirok is zero, however,
the primitive returns a pointer to the first character of the final
directory name.  (If file contains no directory name, the
primitive returns a pointer to its first character when dirok is
zero.)

Ωget_extension() Pget_extension(), primitivechar *get_extension(char *file)≤æ≤
The get_extension( ) primitive returns a pointer to the final
extension of the file name given as its argument.  For example, an
invocation of

Ωget_extension("text.c")æ

would return a pointer to
the ".c" part, and get_extension("text") would return a pointer to
the null character at the end of the string.  Like get_tail( )≈get_tail(),
you can use this primitive to modify the string.

Ωis_path_separator() Pis_path_separator(), primitiveint is_path_separator(int ch)≤æ≤
The is_path_separator( ) primitive tells if a character is
one of the characters that separate directory or drive names in a
file name.  It returns 1 if the character is "¥" or "/",
2 if the character is ":", otherwise 0.  Under Unix, it
returns 1 if the character is "/", otherwise 0.

Ωuser char path_sep;≤æ≤
The path_sep≈path_sep variable contains the preferred character for
separating directory names.  It is normally "¥" in non-Unix
environments.  You may change it to "/" if you prefer Unix-style file
names.  Epsilon will then display file names with "/" instead of with
"¥".  (Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT ignores this setting.  So
does Epsilon for DOS, when running under Windows 95/98.  In these
environments, Epsilon asks the operating system to standardize all
pathnames, and the operating system replaces any "/" with "¥",
making this setting ineffective.)  In Epsilon for Unix, this variable
will be set to / and should not be changed.

Ωadd_final_slash()drop_final_slash() Padd_final_slash(), primitive Pdrop_final_slash(), primitiveadd_final_slash(char *fname)≤drop_final_slash(char *fname)≤æ≤
The add_final_slash( ) primitive adds a path separator
character like / or ¥ to the end of fname, if there
isn't one already.  The drop_final_slash( ) primitive
removes the last character of fname if it's a path separator.
These primitives never count : as a path separator.

Ωis_remote_file()Ris-remote-diris_remote_dir() Pis_remote_file(), primitive Pis_remote_dir(), subroutineint is_remote_file(char *fname)≤int is_remote_dir(char *fname)≤æ≤
The is_remote_file( ) primitive tells whether fname
looks like a valid URL.  It returns 1 if fname starts with a
service name like ftp://, http://, or telnet://, or 2 if fname
appears to be an Emacs-style remote file name like /hostname:filename.

The is_remote_dir( ) subroutine is
somewhat similar; it tries to determine if a fname refers to a
remote directory (or a file pattern; either should be passed to
dired).  It knows that fname can't be a remote directory
unless it's a valid URL with a service type of ftp://.  But then it
has to guess, since it doesn't want to engage in a slow FTP
conversation before returning with an answer.  It assumes that a URL
that ends in a / character is a directory; it recognizes wildcard
characters; it looks for the ~notation that indicates a home
directory.  If none of these indicates a directory name, it returns
zero to indicate something other than a remote directory.

Ωget_executable_directory() Pget_executable_directory(), primitiveget_executable_directory(char *dir)≤æ≤
The get_executable_directory( ) function stores the full
pathname of the directory containing the Epsilon executable into
dir.

Ωlook_up_tree() Plook_up_tree(), subroutinelook_up_tree(char *res, char *file, char *dir, char *stop)≤int is_in_tree(char *file, char *tree)   /* files.e subr. */≤æ≤
The look_up_tree( ) subroutine searches for file in the
given directory dir, its parent directory, and so forth, until it
finds a file named file or reaches the root directory.  If it
finds such a file, it returns nonzero and puts the absolute pathname
of the file into the character array res.  If it doesn't find a
file with the given name, it returns zero and leaves res set to
the last file it looked for.  If file is an absolute pathname to
begin with, it puts the same file name in res, and returns
nonzero if that file exists.  If dir is a null pointer,
look_up_tree( ) begins at the current directory.  If stop
is non-null, the function only examines child directories of the
directory stop.  The function stops as soon as it reaches a
directory other than stop or one of its subdirectories.  This
function assumes that all its parameters are in absolute pathname
form.

is_in_tree() Pis_in_tree(), subroutineThe is_in_tree( ) subroutine returns nonzero if the pathname
file is in the directory specified by dir or one of its
subdirectories.  Both of its parameters must be in absolute pathname
form.

Ωuser char path_list_char;≤æ≤
The path_list_char≈path_list_char variable contains the character separating
the directory names in a configuration variable like EPSPATH.  It is
normally ";", except under Unix, where it is ":".

Ωbuild_filename() Pbuild_filename(), subroutinebuild_filename(char *result, char *pattern, char *file)≤æ≤
The build_filename( ) subroutine constructs file names from
name templates (see Rtemplatesπtemplates).  It copies
pattern to result, replacing the various % template
codes with parts of file, which it obtains by calling the
primitives get_tail( ) and get_extension( ).

Ωfnamecmp()filename_rules()MFSYS_CASE_IGNOREDMFSYS_CASE_PRESERVED Pfnamecmp(), subroutine Pfilename_rules(), primitive PFSYS_CASE_IGNORED, textual macro PFSYS_CASE_PRESERVED, textual macroint fnamecmp(char *f1, char *f2)       /* buffer.e */≤int filename_rules(char *fname)≤æ≤
The fnamecmp( ) subroutine compares two file names like the
strcmp( ) primitive, returning 0 if they're equal, a positive
number if the first comes before the second, or a negative number
otherwise.  However, it does case-folding on the file names first if
this is appropriate for the particular file systems.

The filename_rules( ) primitive asks the operating system if
a certain file system is case-sensitive or case-preserving, and
returns other information too.  It takes the name of any file or
directory (which doesn't have to exist) on the file system, and
returns a code whose values are represented by macros defined in
codes.h.  See Rmixedcasedrivesπmixedcasedrives for more information on
how Epsilon determines the appropriate code for each file system.

MFSYS_CASE_SENSITIVEMFSYS_CASE_UNKNOWN PFSYS_CASE_SENSITIVE, textual macro PFSYS_CASE_UNKNOWN, textual macroThe FSYS_CASE_IGNORED code indicates a non-case-preserving
file system like DOS.  The FSYS_CASE_PRESERVED code
indicates a case-preserving file system like NTFS or VFAT.  The
FSYS_CASE_SENSITIVE code indicates a case-sensitive file
system like Unix.  The FSYS_CASE_UNKNOWN code indicates
that Epsilon couldn't determine anything about the file system.

MFSYS_SHORT_NAMESMFSYS_CASE_MASK PFSYS_SHORT_NAMES, textual macro PFSYS_CASE_MASK, textual macroThe function also returns a bit flag FSYS_SHORT_NAMES,
valid whenever any code but FSYS_CASE_UNKNOWN is returned, that
indicates whether only 8+3 names are supported.  Use the mask macro
FSYS_CASE_MASK to strip off this bit: for example, the
expression

ΩMFSYS_NETWORKMFSYS_CDROMMFSYS_REMOVABLEMFSYS_LOCAL PFSYS_NETWORK, textual macro PFSYS_CDROM, textual macro PFSYS_REMOVABLE, textual macro PFSYS_LOCAL, textual macro(filename_rules(f) & FSYS_CASE_MASK) == FSYS_CASE_SENSITIVE≤æ≤
is nonzero if the file system is case-sensitive.

The primitive also may return a bit indicating the type of drive a
file is located on, if Epsilon can determine this.
FSYS_NETWORK indicates the file is on a different computer
and is being accessed over a network.  FSYS_CDROM indicates
the file is on a CD-ROM disk.  FSYS_REMOVABLE indicates the
file is on a removable medium like a floppy disk or Zip disk.  And
FSYS_LOCAL indicates the file is on a local (non-network)
hard disk.  At most one of the these bits will be present.

Epsilon for Unix returns FSYS_CASE_SENSITIVE for all files,
even if they happen to lie on a file system that might use different
rules natively.  It can't detect the type of drive a file is on
either.

Ωok_file_match() Pok_file_match(), subroutineint ok_file_match(char *s)        /* complete.e */≤æ≤
The ok_file_match( ) subroutine checks a file name to see if
the ¬ignore_file_extensions≈ignore_file_extensions variable should exclude it from
completion.  It returns 0 if the file name should be excluded,
or 1 if the file name is acceptable.

Ωlookpath()Rlookpathlook_on_path()path, searching for files on a Plookpath(), primitive Plook_on_path(), primitivechar *lookpath(char *file, ?int curdir)≤char *look_on_path(char *file, int flags, char *path, ?int skip)≤æ≤
The lookpath( )
primitive looks in various standard Epsilon
directories for a readable file with the supplied name.  As soon as
Epsilon locates the file, it returns the file's name.  If it can't
find the file, it returns a null pointer.  See REPSPATHπEPSPATH
for more information on Epsilon's searching rules.  The
look_on_path( ) primitive is similar, but you can specify
the path to use, and it offers some additional flexibility.  These
primitives will be described together.

First (for either primitive), if the specified file name is an
absolute pathname, Epsilon simply checks to see if the file exists,
and returns its name if it does, or a null pointer otherwise.

MPATH_ADD_CUR_DIR PPATH_ADD_CUR_DIR, textual macroNext, if you call lookpath( ) with its optional parameter
curdir nonzero (or if you call look_on_path( ) with the flag
PATH_ADD_CUR_DIR), Epsilon looks for the file in the
current directory.  If curdir is zero or omitted (or
PATH_ADD_CUR_DIR isn't specified), Epsilon skips this step
(unless the file name explicitly refers to the current directory,
like ".¥filename").

MPATH_ADD_EXE_DIRMPATH_ADD_EXE_PARENT PPATH_ADD_EXE_DIR, textual macro PPATH_ADD_EXE_PARENT, textual macroThe lookpath( ) primitive next looks for the file in the
directory containing the Epsilon executable, then (except in Epsilon
for Unix) in the parent of that directory.  In a typical
installation, Epsilon's executable is in a directory with a name like
c:\epsilon\bin, so this searches for the file in
c:\epsilon\bin, then in c:\epsilon.  The -w4 and -w8
flags tell Epsilon to skip these two steps, respectively.  For
look_on_path( ), you must specify the flag
PATH_ADD_EXE_DIR to search in the executable's directory,
and PATH_ADD_EXE_PARENT to search in its parent.

EPSPATH, configuration variableIf the file still cannot be found,
lookpath( )then locates the EPSPATH, the configuration variable
containing the list of directories for Epsilon to search in.
(look_on_path( ) uses the path provided as a parameter.)  Epsilon
looks in each of the directories in that path for a file with the
given name, returning the full pathname of the file if it finds it,
and a null pointer otherwise.  The path must use the appropriate
syntax for a directory list: directory names separated by colons
under Unix, or by semicolons in other environments.  If there is no
EPSPATH, Epsilon for Unix substitutes
/usr/local/epsilon»VER…:/usr/local/epsilon:/opt/epsilon
(where »VER… is a version string like 10.02; other versions
skip this step in that case.

If you supply look_on_path( ) with an optional skip parameter
of ªnº, it will skip over the first ªnº matches it finds (so long
as its parameter is a relative pathname).  You can use this to reject
a file and look for the next one on a path.

Ωconvert_to_8_3_filename() Pconvert_to_8_3_filename(), primitiveconvert_to_8_3_filename(char *fname)≤æ≤
Under Windows, the convert_to_8_3_filename( ) primitive
modifies the given file name by converting all long file names in
fname to their short "8.3" file name aliases.  Each component of a
short file name has no more than eight characters, a dot, and no more
than three more characters.  For example, the file name "c:¥Windows¥Start Menu¥Programs¥Windows
Explorer.lnk" might be translated to an equivalent file name of
"c:¥Windows¥STARTM~1¥Programs¥WINDOW~1.LNK".  This function operates on both versions of Epsilon
which support Windows-style long file names: the native Windows 95/98/NT
version, and the DOS version (when running under Windows 95/98).  Other
versions of Epsilon will not modify the file name.

3Internet Primitives

 Pdo_telnet(), subroutine Ptelnet_send(), primitive Ptelnet_host(), primitivedo_telnet()telnet_send()telnet_host()Ωtelnet_id Vtelnet_id, variableint telnet_host(char *host, int port, char *buf)≤telnet_send(int id, char *text)≤do_telnet(char *host, int port, char *buf)≤buffer int telnet_id;≤æ≤
Under Windows 95/98/NT and Unix, Epsilon provides various commands
that use Internet FTP, Telnet and similar protocols.  This section
documents how some parts of this interface work.

First, Epsilon provides the primitives telnet_host( ) and
telnet_send( ) for use with the Telnet protocol.  The
telnet_host( ) function establishes a connection to a host on the
specified port, and using the indicated buffer.  It returns an
identification code.  The telnet_send( ) function can use this
code to send text to the host.  Commands normally call the
telnet_host( ) function through the do_telnet( )
subroutine, which records the telnet identification code in the
buffer-specific telnet_id variable, and does other
housekeeping tasks.

Ωfinger_user()http_retrieve()MHTTP_RETRIEVE_WAITMHTTP_RETRIEVE_ONLY_HEADER Pfinger_user(), primitive Phttp_retrieve(), primitive PHTTP_RETRIEVE_WAIT, textual macro PHTTP_RETRIEVE_ONLY_HEADER, textual macroint finger_user(char *user, char *host, char *buf)≤int http_retrieve(char *resource, char *host, int port,≤                  char *auth, char *buf, int flags)≤æ≤
The finger_user( ) primitive uses the Finger protocol to
retrieve information on a particular user (if the host is running a
Finger server).  It takes the user name, the host, and the name of a
buffer in which to put the results.

The http_retrieve( ) primitive uses the HTTP protocol to
retrieve a page from a web site.  It takes a resource name (the final
part of a URL), a host, port, an authorization string (for
password-protected pages) and destination buffer name, plus a set of
flags.  The HTTP_RETRIEVE_WAIT flag tells the function not
to return until the transfer is complete.  Without this flag the
function begins the transfer and lets it continue in the background.
The HTTP_RETRIEVE_ONLY_HEADER flag tells the function to
retrieve only the header of the web page, not the body.  Without this
flag Epsilon will retrieve both; the first blank line retrieved
separates the two.

ΩRftp-opftp_op()do_ftp_op() Pftp_op(), primitive Pdo_ftp_op(), subroutineint ftp_op(char *buf, char *log, char *host, int port,≤           char *usr, char *pwd, char *file, int op)≤int do_ftp_op(char *buf, char *host, char *port,≤              char *usr, char *pwd, char *file, int op)≤æ≤
The ftp_op( ) primitive uses the FTP protocol
to send or retrieve files or get directory listings.  It takes the
destination or source buffer name, the name of a log buffer, a host
computer name and port number, a user name and password, a file name,
and an operation code that indicates what function it should perform
(see below).

The do_ftp_op( ) subroutine is similar to ftp_op( ), but
it chooses the name of an appropriate FTP Log buffer, instead of
taking the name of one as a parameter.  Also, it arranges for the
appropriate ftp_activity( ) function (see below) to be called,
arranges for character-coloring the log buffer, and initializes the
ftp_job structure that Epsilon uses to keep track of each FTP job.

MFTP_RECVMFTP_SENDMFTP_LISTMFTP_MISC PFTP_RECV, textual macro PFTP_SEND, textual macro PFTP_LIST, textual macro PFTP_MISC, textual macroThe FTP_RECV operation code retrieves the specified file
and the FTP_SEND code writes the buffer to the specified
file name.  The FTP_LIST code retrieves a file listing from
the host of files matching the specified file pattern or directory
name.  The FTP_MISC code indicates that the file name
actually contains a series of raw FTP commands to execute after
connecting and logging in, separated by newline characters.  Epsilon
will execute the commands one at a time.

MFTP_OP_MASK PFTP_OP_MASK, textual macroYou can combine one of the above codes with some bit flags that
modify the operation.  Use the FTP_OP_MASK macro to mask
off the bit flags below and extract one of the operation codes above.

MFTP_WAIT PFTP_WAIT, textual macroNormally ftp_op( ) returns immediately, and each of these
operations is carried out in the background.  Add the code
FTP_WAIT to any of the above codes, and the subroutine will
not return until the operation completes.

MFTP_ASCII PFTP_ASCII, textual macroThe FTP_ASCII bit flag modifies the FTP_RECV and
FTP_SEND operations.  It tells Epsilon to perform the transfer
in ASCII mode.  By default, all FTP operations use binary mode, and
Epsilon performs any needed line translation itself.  But this
doesn't work on some host systems (VMS systems, for example).  See
the ¬ftp-ascii-transfers≈ftp-ascii-transfers variable for more information.

MFTP_USE_CWD PFTP_USE_CWD, textual macroThe FTP_USE_CWD bit flag modifies how Epsilon uses the file
name provided for operations like FTP_RECV, FTP_SEND, and
FTP_LIST.  By default, Epsilon sends the file name to the host
as-is.  For example, if you try to read a file
dirname/another/myfile, Epsilon sends an FTP command like RETR
dirname/another/myfile.  Some hosts (such as VMS) use a different
format for directory names than Epsilon's dired directory
editor understands.  So with this flag, Epsilon breaks a file name
apart, and translates a request to read a file such as
dirname/another/myfile into a series of commands to change
directories to dirname, then to another, and then to retrieve
the file myfile.  The ¬ftp-compatible-dirs≈ftp-compatible-dirs variable
controls this.

Ωurl_operation() Purl_operation(), subroutine Pdo_ftp_op(), subroutine Phttp_retrieve(), subroutine Pdo_telnet(), subroutineint url_operation(char *file, int op)≤æ≤
The url_operation( ) subroutine parses a URL and begins
an Internet operation with it.  It takes the URL and an operation
code as described above for ftp_op( ).  If the code is
FTP_RECV, then the URL may indicate a service type of telnet://,
http://, or ftp://, but if the code is FTP_SEND or
FTP_LIST, the service type must be ftp://.  It can modify the
passed URL in place to put it in a standard form.  It calls one of
the functions do_ftp_op( ), http_retrieve( ), or
do_telnet( ) to do its work.

Ωftp_misc_operation() Pftp_misc_operation(), subroutineftp_misc_operation(char *url, char *cmd)≤æ≤
The ftp_misc_operation( ) subroutine uses the
do_ftp_op( ) subroutine to perform a series of raw FTP commands.
It takes an ftp:// URL (ignoring the file name part of it) connects
to the host, logs in, and then executes each of the newline-separated
FTP commands in cmd.  Dired uses this function to delete or move
a group of files.

Ωwhen_net_activity Vwhen_net_activity, buffer-specific variablebuffer int (*when_net_activity)();≤net_activity(int activity, int buf, int from, int to)≤æ≤
As Epsilon performs Internet functions, it calls an EEL function to
advise it of its progress.  The buffer-specific variable
when_net_activity contains a function pointer to the
function to call.  Epsilon uses the value of this variable in the
destination buffer (or, in the case of the πMNET_LOG_WRITE and
πMNET_LOG_DONE codes below, the log buffer).  If the variable is
zero in a buffer, Epsilon won't call any EEL function as it proceeds.

The EEL function will always be called from within a call to
getkey( ) or delay( ), so it must save any state information
it needs to change, such as the current buffer, the position of
point, and so forth, using save_var.  The subroutine
net_activity() shown above indicates what parameters the function
should take--there's not actually a function by that name.

MNET_RECVMNET_DONE PNET_RECV, textual macro PNET_DONE, textual macroThe activity parameter indicates the event that just occurred.  A
value of NET_RECV indicates that Epsilon has just received
some characters and inserted them in a buffer.  The buf parameter
tells which buffer is involved.  The from and to values
indicate the new characters.  A value of NET_DONE means
that the net job running in buffer buf has finished.  The above
are the only activity codes generated for HTTP, Telnet, or Finger
jobs.

MNET_SENDMNET_LOG_WRITEMNET_LOG_DONE PNET_SEND, textual macro PNET_LOG_WRITE, textual macro PNET_LOG_DONE, textual macroFTP jobs have some more possible codes.  NET_SEND indicates
that another block of text has been sent.  In this case, from
indicates that number of bytes sent already from buffer buf, and
to indicates the total number of bytes to be sent.  The code
NET_LOG_WRITE indicates that some more text has been
written to the log buffer buf, in the range from...to.
Finally, the code NET_LOG_DONE indicates that the FTP
operation has finished writing to the log buffer.  It occurs right
after a NET_DONE call on FTP jobs.

Ωftp_activity()buffer_ftp_activity Pftp_activity(), subroutine Vbuffer_ftp_activity, variableftp_activity(int activity, int buf, int from, int to)≤finger_activity(int activity, int buf, int from, int to)≤telnet_activity(int activity, int buf, int from, int to)≤buffer int (*buffer_ftp_activity)();≤æ≤
The file epsnet.e defines the when_net_activity functions shown
above, which provide status messages and similar things for each type
of job.  The ftp_activity( ) subroutine also calls a
subroutine itself, defined just like these functions, through the
buffer-specific variable buffer_ftp_activity.  The
¬dired command uses this to arrange for normal FTP activity
processing when retrieving directory listings, but also some
processing unique to dired.

Ωgethostname()host name, retrieving Pgethostname(), primitiveint gethostname(char *host, ?int method)≤æ≤
The gethostname( ) primitive
sets host to the computer's Internet host name and returns 0.
If it can't for any reason, it returns 1 and sets host to "?".
This primitive is only available under Unix and Windows 95/98/NT.

Epsilon uses the method parameter only under Windows.  If
method is 2, Epsilon asks Winsock for the computer's name.  If
Winsock is set to auto-dial on demand, it's possible that this
request will make it dial.  Any other value for method makes
Epsilon ask Windows itself for the computer's name.  These two
computer names are set in different places in the control panel and
are often different.

4Parsing URL's

 Pprepare_url_operation(), subroutineprepare_url_operation()Ω Pftp_op(), subroutineprepare_url_operation(char *file, int op, struct url_parts *parts)≤get_password(char *res, char *host, char *usr)≤int parse_url(char *url, struct url_parts *p)≤æ≤
Several subroutines handle parsing URL's into their component parts.
These parts are stored in a url_parts structure, which has fields
for a URL's service (http, ftp, and so forth), host name, port, user
name if any, password if any, and the "file name": the final part
of a URL, that may be a file name, a web page name or something else.
Since an empty user name or password is legal, but is different from
an omitted one, there are also fields to specify if each of these is
present.

get_password() Pget_password(), subroutineThe prepare_url_operation( ) subroutine parses a URL and
fills one of these structures.  It complains if it doesn't recognize
the service name, or if the service is something other than FTP but
the operation isn't reading.  The operation code is one of those used
with the ftp_op( ) subroutine described in Rftpopπftp-op.  For example, it complains if you try to perform an
FTP_LIST operation with a telnet:// URL.  It also prompts for a
password if necessary, and saves the password for later use, by
calling the get_password( ) subroutine.

The get_password( ) subroutine gets the password for a
particular user/host combination.  Specify the user and host, and the
subroutine will fill in the provided character array res with the
password.  The first time it will prompt the user for the
information; it will then store the information and return it without
prompting in future requests.  The subroutine is careful to make sure
the password never appears in a state file or session file.  To
discard a particular remembered password, pass NULL as the first
parameter.  The next time get_password( ) is asked for the
password of that user on that host, it will prompt the user again.

parse_url() Pparse_url(), subroutineThe prepare_url_operation( ) subroutine calls the
parse_url( ) subroutine to actually parse the URL into a
url_parts structure.  The latter returns zero if the URL is
invalid, or nonzero if it appears to be legal.

Ωsplit_string()reverse_split_string() Psplit_string(), subroutine Preverse_split_string(), subroutineint split_string(char *part1, char *cs, char *part2)≤int reverse_split_string(char *part1, char *cs, char *part2)≤æ≤
The parse_url( ) subroutine uses two helper subroutines.  The
split_string( ) subroutine divides a string part1 into
two parts, by searching it for one of a set of delimiter characters
cs.  It finds the first character in part1 that appears in
cs.  Then it copies the remainder of part1 to part2, and
removes the delimiter character and the remainder from part1.  It
returns the delimiter character it found.  If no delimiter character
appears in part1, it sets part2 to "" and returns 0.
The reverse_split_string( ) subroutine is almost identical;
it just searches through part1 from the other end, and splits the
string at the last character in part1 that appears in cs.

Ωget_url_file_part() Pget_url_file_part(), subroutinechar *get_url_file_part(char *url, int sep)≤æ≤
The get_url_file_part( ) subroutine helps to parse URL's.
It takes a URL and returns a pointer to a position within it where
its file part begins.  For example, in the URL
http://www.lugaru.com/why-lugaru.html, the subroutine returns a
pointer to the start of "why".  If sep is nonzero, the
subroutine instead returns a pointer to the / just before "why".
If its parameter is not a URL, the subroutine returns a pointer to
its first character.

3Tagging Internals

 Ptag_suffix_none(), subroutinetag_suffix_none()ReeltagsThis section describes how to add tagging support to Epsilon for
other languages.  Epsilon already knows how to find tags in C and EEL
files, and in assembly languages files.

Ωtag_suffix_default() Ptag_suffix_default(), subroutinetag_suffix_ext()     /* example function */≤tag_suffix_none()≤tag_suffix_default()≤æ≤
When Epsilon wants to add tags for a file, it looks at the file's
extension and constructs a function name of the form
tag_suffix_»ext…(), where »ext… is the extension.  It
tries to call this function to tag the file.  If the file has no
extension, it tries to call tag_suffix_none( ).  If there is no
function with the appropriate name, Epsilon calls
tag_suffix_default( ) instead.  Thus, to add tagging for a
language that uses file names ending in .xyz, define a function named
tag_suffix_xyz().

Ωadd_tag() Padd_tag(), subroutineadd_tag(char *func, int pos)≤æ≤
The tagging function will be called with point positioned at the
start of the buffer to be tagged.  (Epsilon preserves the old
value of point.)  It should search through the buffer, looking for
names it wishes to tag.  To add a tag, it should call the subroutine
add_tag( ), passing it the tag name and the offset of
the first character of the name within the file.  You can use the
tagging functions for C and assembler as examples to write your own
tagging functions.  They are in the source file tags.e.

 Pdisk_space(), subroutinedisk_space()Ωstruct disk_info {≤        short sects_per_cluster, bytes_per_sector;≤        short avail_clusters, tot_clusters;≤};≤disk_space(char *disk, struct disk_info *d_info) /* lowlevel.e */≤æ≤
Epsilon's disk_space( ) subroutine requests information
about a particular disk drive from the system.  It takes the number
of the drive (A is 1, B is 2, and so forth) and a pointer to a
disk_info structure as defined above (the declaration also
appears in eel.h).  The subroutine fills the structure with the
indicated information.  (This subroutine is not available in Epsilon
for Windows or Unix.)

Ωgetenv()putenv()environment variable, reading Pgetenv(), primitive Pputenv(), primitivechar *getenv(char *name)≤putenv(char *name)≤char *verenv(char *name)≤æ≤

Use the getenv( ) primitive to return entries from the
environment.  The primitive returns a null pointer if no environment
variable name exists.  For example, after the DOS command
"set waldo=abcdef", the expression getenv("waldo") will
return the string "abcdef".

The putenv( ) primitive puts strings in the environment.
Normally environment entries have the form "NAME=definition".  This
primitive manipulates Epsilon's copy of the environment, which is
passed on to any program that Epsilon runs, but it doesn't affect the
environment you get when you exit from Epsilon.  The value of the
argument to putenv( ) is evaluated later, when you actually
invoke some other program from within Epsilon.  For this reason, it
is important that the argument to putenv( ) not be a local
variable.

verenv() Pverenv(), primitiveThe verenv( ) primitive gets configuration variables.  In
Epsilon for Windows 3.1, verenv( ) looks for entries in Epsilon's
lugeps.ini file, while Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT looks in the system
registry.  Under Unix, DOS and OS/2, it retrieves the variables from the
environment, like getenv( ).

Regardless of the operating system, this primitive looks for
alternate, version-specific forms of the specified configuration
variable.  For example, in version 7.0 of Epsilon,
verenv("MYVAR") would return the value of a variable named
MYVAR70, if one existed.  If not, it would try the name MYVAR7.  If
neither existed, it would return the value of MYVAR (or a null
pointer if none of these variables were found).  See Rconfigvarsπconfigvars for complete information on configuration
variables.

Ωshort opsys;≤#define OS_DOS  1    /* DOS or Windows */≤#define OS_OS2  2    /* OS/2 */≤#define OS_UNIX 3    /* Unix */≤æ≤
The opsys≈opsys variable tells which operating system version of
Epsilon is running, using the macros shown above and defined in
codes.h.  The primitive returns the same value for DOS and Windows;
see the next definition to distinguish these.

ΩMIS_WIN32SMIS_NTMIS_WIN95MIS_WIN31 PIS_WIN32S, textual macro PIS_NT, textual macro PIS_WIN95, textual macro PIS_WIN31, textual macroshort is_gui;≤#define IS_WIN32S   1   /* (not supported) */≤#define IS_NT       2≤#define IS_WIN95    3≤#define IS_WIN31    4   /* 16-bit version always says this */≤æ≤
The is_gui≈is_gui variable lets an EEL program determine if it's
running in a version of Epsilon that provides dialogs.  The variable
is zero in the Unix, DOS and OS/2 versions of Epsilon, but nonzero in
all Windows versions.  The values IS_WIN32S,
IS_NT, and IS_WIN95 indicate that the 32-bit
version of Epsilon is running, and occur when the 32-bit version runs
under Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and Windows 95/98, respectively.
(Note that the 32-bit version doesn't currently run under Windows
3.1, so this value will not occur.)  The 16-bit version of Epsilon
for Windows always uses the value IS_WIN31, even if you
happen to be running it under Windows NT or Windows 95/98.

ΩMIS_UNIX_XWINMIS_UNIX_TERM PIS_UNIX_XWIN, textual macro PIS_UNIX_TERM, textual macroshort is_unix;≤#define IS_UNIX_TERM   1≤#define IS_UNIX_XWIN   2≤æ≤
The is_unix≈is_unix variable is nonzero if Epsilon for Unix is
running.  It's set to the constant IS_UNIX_XWIN if Epsilon
is running as an X program, or IS_UNIX_TERM if Epsilon is
running as a terminal program.

ΩMIS_WIN32_GUIMIS_WIN32_CONSOLE PIS_WIN32_GUI, textual macro PIS_WIN32_CONSOLE, textual macroshort is_win32;≤#define IS_WIN32_GUI        1≤#define IS_WIN32_CONSOLE    2≤æ≤
The is_win32≈is_win32 variable is nonzero if a version of Epsilon for
Windows 95/98/NT is running, either the GUI version or the Win32 console
version.  The constant IS_WIN32_GUI represents the former.
The constant IS_WIN32_CONSOLE represents the latter.

Ωint has_feature;≤æ≤
Epsilon provides the has_feature≈has_feature variable so an EEL function can
determine which facilities are available in the current environment.  Bits
represent possible features.  Often these indicate whether a certain
primitive is implemented.

The ding( ) primitive produces a beeping sound, usually called
the bell.  It is useful for alerting the user to some error.  Instead
of calling ding( ) directly, however, EEL commands should call the
maybe_ding( ) subroutine defined in disp.e instead.  It calls
ding( )≈ding() only if the variable ¬want_bell≈want_bell is nonzero, and
its parameter is nonzero.  Pass one of the bell_on_ variables
listed in Rbellonπbell-on- as the parameter.  The sound that
ding( ) makes is controlled by the ¬beep-duration≈beep-duration and
¬beep-frequency≈beep-frequency variables.  See Rbeepingπbeeping.

Ωclipboard_available()buffer_to_clipboard() Pclipboard_available(), primitive Pbuffer_to_clipboard(), primitiveint clipboard_available()≤int buffer_to_clipboard(int buffer_number, int convert_newlines,≤                        int clipboard_format)≤int clipboard_to_buffer(int buffer_number, int convert_newlines,≤                        int clipboard_format)≤æ≤
The clipboard_available( ) primitive tells whether Epsilon
can access the system clipboard in this environment.  It returns
nonzero if the clipboard is available, or zero if not.  Epsilon for
Windows can always access the clipboard.  Epsilon for DOS can access
the clipboard when running under Windows 3.1 or Windows 95/98.
Epsilon for Unix can access the clipboard when it runs as an X
program.

The buffer_to_clipboard( ) primitive copies the indicated
buffer to the clipboard.  A clipboard_format of zero means use
the default format; otherwise, it specifies a particular Windows
clipboard format code.  If convert_newlines is nonzero, Epsilon
will add a ⁄Return€ character before each ⁄Newline€ character
it puts on the clipboard.  This is the normal format for clipboard
text.  If convert_newlines is zero, Epsilon will put an exact
copy of the buffer on the clipboard.

clipboard_to_buffer() Pclipboard_to_buffer(), primitiveThe clipboard_to_buffer( ) primitive replaces the contents
of the given buffer with the text on the clipboard.  The
clipboard_format parameter has the same meaning as above.  If
convert_newlines is nonzero, Epsilon will strip all ⁄Return€
characters from the clipboard text before putting it in the buffer.

Ωsignal_suspend() Psignal_suspend(), primitivesignal_suspend()≤æ≤
In Epsilon for Unix, the signal_suspend( ) primitive
suspends Epsilon's job.  Use the shell's fg command to resume it.
When Epsilon runs as an X program, this primitive minimizes Epsilon
instead.

3Window System Primitives

 Pwindows_restore(), primitive Pwindows_minimize(), primitive Pwindows_maximize(), primitivewindows_restore()windows_minimize()windows_maximize()All the primitives in this section are only available in Epsilon for
Windows (except for a few that are also available in Epsilon for Unix
when running as an X window system program).  Calling them from other
versions of Epsilon either does nothing, or produces an error message.

Ωwindows_maximize()≤windows_minimize()≤windows_restore()≤æ≤
In Epsilon for Windows (and in Unix under X), the
windows_maximize( ), windows_minimize( ), and
windows_restore( ) primitives perform the indicated action
on the main Epsilon screen.

ΩRdragdropresultdrag_drop_result() Pdrag_drop_result(), primitiveint drag_drop_result(char *file)≤drag_drop_handler()≤æ≤
Epsilon uses the drag_drop_result( )
primitive to retrieve the names of files dropped on an Epsilon window
using drag and drop, after receiving the event key
πMWIN_DRAG_DROP.  Pass the primitive a character array big enough
to hold a file name.  The primitive will return a nonzero value and
fill the array with the first file name.  Call the primitive again to
retrieve the next file name.  When the function returns zero, there
are no more file names.

Epsilon uses this same method to retrieve DDE messages.  When a DDE
message arrives from another program, Epsilon parses the message as
if it were a command line and then adds each file name to its list of
drag-drop results.

When Epsilon returns the πMWIN_DRAG_DROP key, it also sets some
mouse variables to indicate the source of the files that can be
retrieved through drag_drop_result( ).  It sets
mouse_screen, mouse_x, mouse_y, and similar
variables to indicate exactly where the files were dropped.  If the
message arrived via DDE, then mouse_screen will be -1.

drag_drop_handler() Pdrag_drop_handler(), subroutineThe drag_drop_handler( ) subroutine in mouse.e handles the
πMWIN_DRAG_DROP key.  Don't bind this key to a subroutine with a
different name; Epsilon requires that the πMWIN_DRAG_DROP key be
bound to a function named drag_drop_handler( ) for correct
handling of drag-drop.

Ωdde_open()dde_execute()dde_close()DDE messages, sending Pdde_open(), primitive Pdde_execute(), primitive Pdde_close(), primitiveint dde_open(char *server, char *topic)≤int dde_execute(int conv, char *msg, int timeout)≤int dde_close(int conv)≤æ≤
Epsilon provides some primitives that
you can use to send a DDE Execute message to another program under
Windows.

First call dde_open( ) to open a conversation, providing the name of
a DDE server and the topic name.  It returns a conversation handle, or 0 if
it couldn't open the conversation for any reason.

To send each DDE message, call dde_execute( ).  Pass the
conversation handle from dde_open( ), the DDE Execute message text to
send, and a timeout value in milliseconds (10000, the recommended value,
waits 10 seconds for a response).  The primitive returns nonzero if it
successfully sent the message.

Finally, call dde_close( ) when you've completed sending DDE Execute
messages, passing the conversation handle.  It returns nonzero if it
successfully closed the connection.

4WinHelp Interface

 Pwin_help_string(), primitive Pwin_help_contents(), primitivewin_help_string()win_help_contents()Ωint win_help_contents(char *file)≤æ≤
The win_help_contents( ) primitive displays the contents
page of the specified Windows help file.  If the file
parameter is "", it uses Epsilon's help file, displaying help on
Epsilon.  The function returns a nonzero value if it was successful.

Ωint win_help_string(char *file, char *key)≤æ≤
The win_help_string( ) primitive looks up the entry for
key in the specified Windows help file.  If the key parameter
is "", it shows the list of possible keywords.  If the
file parameter is "", it uses Epsilon's help file,
displaying help on Epsilon.  The function returns a nonzero value if
it was successful.

Ωwindows_help_from() Pwindows_help_from(), subroutinewindows_help_from(char *file, int show_contents)≤æ≤
The windows_help_from( ) subroutine wraps the above two
subroutines.  If there's a suitable highlighted region, it calls
win_help_string( ) to display help on the keyword text in the
highlighted region.  Otherwise, it either displays the help file's
contents topic (if show_contents is nonzero), or the help file's
keyword index.  The windows_help_from( ) subroutine also handles
tasks like displaying an error if the user isn't running Epsilon for
Windows.

4Menu Bar Primitives

 Pwin_display_menu(), primitive Pwin_load_menu(), primitivewin_display_menu()win_load_menu()Ωint win_load_menu(char *file)≤win_display_menu(int show)≤æ≤
The win_load_menu( ) primitive makes Epsilon read the
specified menu file (normally gui.mnu), replacing all previous
menu definitions.  See the comments in the gui.mnu file for
details on its format.  The win_display_menu( ) primitive
makes Epsilon display its menu bar, when its show parameter is
nonzero.  When show is zero, the primitive makes Epsilon remove
the menu bar from the screen.

Ωwin_menu_popup() Pwin_menu_popup(), primitiveint win_menu_popup(char *menu_name)≤æ≤
The win_menu_popup( ) primitive pops up a context menu, as
typically displayed by the right mouse button.  The menu name must
match one of the menu tags defined in the file gui.mnu, usually
the tag "_popup".

Ωinvoke_menu() Pinvoke_menu(), primitiveinvoke_menu(int letter)≤æ≤
The invoke_menu( ) primitive acts like typing Alt-»letter…
in a normal Windows program.  For example, invoke_menu('e') pulls
down the Edit menu.  Invoke_menu(' ') pulls down the system menu.
And invoke_menu(0) highlights the first menu item, but doesn't
pull it down, like tapping and releasing the Alt key in a typical
Windows program.  (Also see the variable alt-invokes-menu.)

Several primitives let you manipulate the
tool bar.  They only operate in the 32-bit Windows version, under
Windows 95/98 or Windows NT (3.51 or later).  The
toolbar_create( ) primitive creates a new, empty tool bar.
The toolbar_destroy( ) primitive hides the tool bar, deleting
its contents.  The toolbar_add_separator( ) primitive adds a
blank space between buttons to the end of the tool bar.

The toolbar_add_button( ) primitive adds a new button to the
end of the tool bar.  The cmd parameter contains the name of an
EEL function to run.  The help parameter says what "tool tip"
help text to display, if the user positions the mouse cursor over the
button.  The icon parameter specifies which icon to use.  In this
version, it must be one of these standard names:

In the Windows version of Epsilon, the select_printer( )
primitive displays a dialog box that lets the user choose a printer,
select page numbers, and so forth.  The flags and parameters are a
subset of those of the Windows API function PrintDlg().  The
primitive returns zero if the user canceled printing, or nonzero if
the user now wants to print.  In the latter case, Epsilon will have
filled in the height and width parameters of the provided
structure with the number of characters that can fit on a page of
text using the selected printer.

page_setup_dialog() Ppage_setup_dialog(), primitiveThe page_setup_dialog( ) displays the standard Windows page
setup dialog, which you can use to set printer margins or switch to a
different printer.

After using the select_printer( ) primitive, an EEL program that
wishes to print must execute the start_print_job( )
primitive.  It takes a string specifying the name of this job in the
print queue.  The EEL program can then print one or more
pages, ending each page with a call to print_eject( ).
After all pages have been printed, the EEL program must call
end_print_job( ).

To actually produce output, two primitives are available.  The
print_line( ) primitive simply prints the given line of
text, and advances to the next line.  The print_window( )
primitive prints the contents of a special kind of Epsilon window.
The window must have been created by calling
create_invisible_window( ), passing it the desired
dimensions of the window, in characters, and the buffer it should
display.  The create_invisible_window( ) primitive returns a
window handle which can be passed to print_window( ).  An EEL
program can move through the buffer, letting different parts of the
buffer "show" in this window, to accomplish printing the entire
buffer.  The invisible window may be deleted using the
window_kill( ) primitive once the desired text has been printed.

The time_ms( ) primitive returns the time in milliseconds since
some arbitrary event in the past.  Eventually, the value resets to 0,
but just when this occurs varies with the environment.  In some
cases, the returned value resets to 0 once a day, while others only
wrap around after longer periods.

time_remaining() Ptime_remaining(), primitiveThe time_begin( ) and time_done( ) primitives
provide easier ways to time events.  Both use the TIMER
data type, which is built into Epsilon.  The time_begin( )
primitive takes a pointer to a TIMER structure and a delay in
hundredths of a second.  It starts a timer contained in the TIMER
structure.  The time_done() primitive takes a pointer to a TIMER
that has previously been passed to time_begin( ) and returns
nonzero if and only if the indicated delay has elapsed.  The
time_remaining( ) primitive returns the number of hundredths
of a second until the delay of the provided timer elapses.  If the
delay has already elapsed, the function returns zero.  You can pass
-1 to time_begin( ) to create a timer that will never expire;
time_remaining( ) will always return a large number for such a
timer, and time_done( ) will always return zero.

Also see the delay( ) primitive in Rdelayπdelay.

The time_and_day( ) primitive requests the current time and day
from the operating system, and fills in the time_info structure

Under DOS, the do_interrupt( )do_interrupt()  Pdo_interrupt(), primitiveprimitive executes the 8086 machine
language instruction INT, which causes a software interrupt.
Application programs such as Epsilon use interrupts to communicate
with lower-level operating system software, such as DOS or BIOS.
This primitive lets EEL programs communicate directly with operating
system software.  The primitive sets the machine registers from the
values in the regs union.  Then it executes an interrupt whose
number is intnumber.  When the interrupt finishes, Epsilon
stores the contents of the machine registers back into the regs
union.  It also stores the contents of the flag word in the member
named flags.

In the following discussion we assume some familiarity with the 8086
architecture.

 Pdisk_space(), subroutineThe disk_space( ) subroutine defined in lowlevel.e demonstrates
the use of the do_interrupt( )≈do_interrupt() primitive.  It calls DOS to
get information on the capacity of a disk, including how much space
is still available.

Ωdisk_space(disk, info)     /* put information on disk in info */≤        struct disk_info *info;≤{≤    m_regs.b.ah = 0x36;≤      /* get disk free space */≤    m_regs.b.dl = disk;≤      /* for this drive (0=default, 1=A, ...) */≤    do_interrupt(DOS_SERVICES, &m_regs);≤    info->sects_per_cluster = m_regs.w.ax;≤      /* -1 means invalid drive */≤    info->bytes_per_sector = m_regs.w.cx;≤    info->avail_clusters = m_regs.w.bx;≤    info->tot_clusters = m_regs.w.dx;≤}≤æ≤
The function uses the global variable m_regs instead of
declaring its own union with type M_REGS.  Several functions use this
variable, but they could each declare their own local variables
instead.  M_REGS is defined as a union so that functions can refer to
either the byte registers or the word registers without doing
bit arithmetic.  Notice how this is done: .b.ah refers to the AH
register, while .w.ax refers to the AX register.

MDOS_SERVICES PDOS_SERVICES, textual macroThe DOS function requires the value 36 (hex) in register AH and the
disk number in DL.  The macro DOS_SERVICES expands to 21 (hex),
the number of the "DOS services" interrupt.  In the call to
do_interrupt( )≈do_interrupt(), the m_regs variable appears with &
before it, since the primitive requires a pointer to the register
union.  (This is actually a simplified version of the
disk_space( ) function, for illustrative purposes.)

The next example shows how to pass EEL character pointers to DOS
routines with the do_interrupt( )≈do_interrupt() primitive.  It shows how the
delete_file( )≈delete_file() function could have been written if it were not
a primitive.

Ω#include "lowlevel.h"≤≤del_file(name)≤    char *name;≤{≤    EEL_PTR *x;≤≤    strlen(name);             /* check addressability */≤    x = (EEL_PTR *)&name;     /* ds:dx has name */≤    m_regs.w.ds = x->value.hiword;≤    m_regs.w.dx = x->value.loword;≤≤    m_regs.b.ah = 0x41;       /* delete file function */≤    do_interrupt(DOS_SERVICES, &m_regs);≤    if (m_regs.w.flags & CARRYFLAG) {≤        errno = m_regs.w.ax;  /* error occurred */≤        return -1;≤    } else≤        return 0;≤}≤æ≤
The del_file( )del_file()  Pdel_file(), subroutinesubroutine takes the name of a file and tries to
delete it.  It returns 0 if successful and -1 otherwise,
and in the latter case it puts an error code in the variable
errno.  The subroutine works by calling the DOS function Delete
File, which requires a pointer to the name of the file to delete in
the DS:DX register pair.  Thus, it's necessary to convert the EEL
character pointer in name to a pair of short integers suitable
for putting in the machine registers.  This can be done using the
variable x, which we declare in the example as type
EEL_PTR.

Ωtypedef struct eel_pointer {    /* format of EEL pointer */≤        struct {≤                short loword, hiword;≤        } base, size, value;≤} EEL_PTR;≤æ≤
The EEL_PTR type is a structure representing the internal format
of an EEL pointer (except for function pointers, which are
represented as short integers internally).  An EEL pointer consists
of a base, a size, and a value.  The base and value
are standard 8086 32-bit pointers, and the size is an integer.
Epsilon compares the three fields to catch invalid pointer usage.

Whenever a function dereferences a pointer, Epsilon checks that the
fields are consistent.  That is, it makes sure that value is
greater than or equal to base, and that value is less than
base+size.  Epsilon will report an illegal dereference if
these conditions are not met.

When Epsilon constructs a pointer, it sets the base field to the
start of the block of storage within which the pointer points, and
sets the size field to the size of the block of storage, in bytes.
Epsilon then sets the value field to the actual address to which the
pointer points.  For example, if an EEL pointer p points to the
letter "c" in the string "abcd" (which is terminated by a null
byte), the size field of p will contain a 5, the base field will
point to the "a", and the value field will point to the "c".
Adding an integer to p will change only the value field.  Notice
that the modified version of p is "consistent" according to
the rules above exactly when dereferencing it would be legal:
*(p - 2), *(p - 1), *p, *(p + 1) and
*(p + 2).  Also see the ptrlen( ) primitive in Rptrlenπptrlen.

For our del_file( ) example, we need only the value field in the
string name.  The function extracts the value field via the
"trick" of setting x to point at the name variable, and
accessing its fields through x, a pointer to a structure whose
fields match the internal structure of an EEL pointer.  The variable
serves as a sort of X-ray that lets us see the fields inside an
apparently solid pointer.  The subroutine then extracts the value part
of the pointer as a pair of 16-bit numbers, and puts them in the
correct machine register fields of m_regs.

Ωget_pointer() Pget_pointer(), subroutine Pget_pointer(), subroutineint get_pointer(EEL_PTR *p, int segment)≤   /* for get_pointer() calls */≤#define OFFSET  0≤#define SEGMENT 1≤æ≤
It's better, though, to use the subroutine get_pointer( ) to
disassemble a pointer in this way, as this insulates you from changes
in the format of a pointer.  It takes a pointer and returns either its
segment or its offset (an argument controls which).  The subroutine
works by disassembling the pointer as described above.  Using
get_pointer( ), the above program would become:

Ω#include "lowlevel.h"≤≤del_file(name)≤    char *name;≤{≤    strlen(name);             /* check addressability */≤    m_regs.w.ds = get_pointer(name, SEGMENT);≤    m_regs.w.dx = get_pointer(name, !SEGMENT);≤                              /* ds:dx has name */≤    m_regs.b.ah = 0x41;       /* delete file function */≤    do_interrupt(DOS_SERVICES, &m_regs);≤    if (m_regs.w.flags & CARRYFLAG) {≤        errno = m_regs.w.ax;  /* error occurred */≤        return -1;≤    } else≤        return 0;≤}≤æ≤
After the do_interrupt( )≈do_interrupt() primitive, the subroutine checks to
see if the file was deleted by examining the carry flag.  DOS will
set this flag if it cannot delete the file for some reason.  If it
failed, the subroutine must transfer the error code from where DOS
puts it, in AX, to the errno variable.

The only part of the subroutine that we haven't explained is the call
to the strlen( )≈strlen() primitive at the beginning.  This checks to
make sure the file name is a proper string.  Since DOS doesn't know
anything about the rules for EEL pointers, it won't necessarily report
anything amiss if name is a null pointer, or
illegal in some other way.  The strlen( )≈strlen() primitive happens to
do just the right kind of check, so the subroutine calls it.  If
name is invalid (a null pointer, not null-terminated, or
whatever) strlen( )≈strlen() will abort the function with an appropriate
message.

Ωpeek()poke() Ppeek(), primitive Ppoke(), primitiveint peek(int segment, int offset)≤poke(int segment, int offset, int value)≤æ≤
For low-level machine access under DOS, the peek( ) primitive may
be used to access any byte of memory in the computer.  It takes an 8086
segment and offset and returns the byte at that location.  The
poke( ) primitive sets the byte at the given location.

3Calling Windows DLL's

 Pcall_dll(), primitivedynamic-link libraries, under WindowsDLL's, under Windowslow-level operationscall_dll()

Ωint call_dll(char *dll_name, char *func_name,≤             char *ftype, char *args, ...)≤æ≤
The call_dll( ) primitive calls a function in a Windows DLL.
The 32-bit version of Epsilon can only call 32-bit DLL's, while the
16-bit version can only call 16-bit DLL's.  The dll_name
parameter specifies the DLL file name.  The func_name parameter
specifies the name of the particular function you want to call.

The ftype parameter specifies the routine's calling convention.
The character C specifies the C calling convention, while P
specifies the Pascal calling convention.  Most Windows DLL's use the
Pascal calling convention, but any function that accepts a variable
number of parameters must use the C calling convention.

The args parameter specifies the type of each remaining
parameter.  Each letter in args specifies the type of one
parameter, according to the following table.

Ω– c2 16 34 CharacterDescriptionLunsigned longDWORDIintINT, UINT, HWND, most other handlesSfar char *LPSTRPfar void *LPVOIDRfar void **LPVOID *—æ

In 16-bit Epsilon, the I character represents a 16-bit parameter,
while in 32-bit Epsilon, I represents a 32-bit parameter, and is
equivalent to L.  L, S, P, and R always represent
32-bit parameters.

S represents a null-terminated string being
sent to the DLL.  P is passed similarly, but Epsilon will not
check the string for null termination.  It's useful when the string
is an output parameter of the DLL, and may not be null-terminated
before the call, or when passing structure pointers to a DLL.

R indicates that a DLL function returns a pointer by reference.
Epsilon will pass the pointer you supply (if any) and retrieve the
result.  Use this for DLL functions that require a pointer to a
pointer, and pass the address of any EEL variable whose type is
"pointer to ..."  (other than "pointer to function").

Here's an example, using call_dll( ) to determine the main Windows
directory:

Ω#define GetWindowsDirectory(dir, size)  (is_gui == IS_WIN31 ¥≤    ? call_dll("kernel.dll", "GetWindowsDirectory", ¥≤               "p", "pi", dir, size) ¥≤    : call_dll("kernel32.dll", "GetWindowsDirectoryA", ¥≤               "p", "pi", dir, size))≤≤    char dir[FNAMELEN];≤≤    GetWindowsDirectory(dir, FNAMELEN);≤    say("The Windows directory is ≥s", dir);≤æ≤
A DLL function that exists in both 16-bit and 32-bit environments
will usually be in different .dll files, and will often go by a
different name.  Its parameters will often be different as well.  In
particular, remember that a structure that includes int members will
be a different size in the two environments.  To write an EEL
interface to a DLL function that takes a pointer to such a structure,
you'll need to declare two different versions of the structure, and
pass the correct one to the DLL function, if you want your EEL
interface to work in both 16-bit and 32-bit environments.

After you call a function in a DLL, Epsilon keeps the DLL loaded to
make future calls fast.  You can unload a DLL loaded by
call_dll( ) by including just the name of the DLL, and omitting
the name of any function or parameters.  For example,
call_dll("extras.dll"); unloads a DLL named extras.dll.

Ωmake_pointer() Pmake_pointer(), primitivechar *make_pointer(int value)≤æ≤
The make_pointer( ) primitive can be useful when interacting
with system DLL's.  It takes a machine address as a number, and
returns an EEL pointer that may be used to access memory at that
address.  No error checking will be done on the validity of the
pointer.

3Calling OS/2 DLL's

Under DOS, the do_interrupt( )≈do_interrupt() primitive performs a software
interrupt, requesting a service from lower-level software like DOS or
BIOS.  Under OS/2, this primitive does the corresponding thing: it
calls a particular dynamic-link library routine.  (OS/2 doesn't use
software interrupts to communicate with other software.)

The do_interrupt( )≈do_interrupt() primitive takes an ordinal value and a
pointer to a structure.  The structure contains the name of the
library to be called, the name of the routine within that library,
space for a return value and an error code, a parameter count, and a
list of parameters.

config.sys filedllcall Vdllcall, variableLIBPATH, environment variableTo use this function, first allocate a structure of the correct type
(or use the predeclared global one called dllcall).  Put a
character pointer to the name of the library containing the routine
to be called into the structure.  The library name has neither a
directory name nor an extension.  OS/2 will automatically search for
it along the LIBPATH defined by your
config.sys file.

There are two ways to indicate which procedure in the library is to
be called.  You may either provide the procedure's ordinal number as the
first parameter to do_interrupt( ), or provide 0 as the ordinal
number and pass the name as a string in the structure.

It is vital to specify count, the number of parameters the procedure
expects to receive.  This is figured in 2-byte words, so if the
procedure expects a pointer and an additional word, that would be 3
parameters.  The parameters themselves then appear, with the first
parameter in the array the first to be pushed.  Parameters past the
value indicated in count are ignored.

When do_interrupt( ) is called, the values of the result and
error members of the structure are ignored.  If the indicated
routine can't be invoked for some reason, Epsilon sets error to
the OS/2 error code that indicates why.  Otherwise it's set to zero,
and Epsilon copies the return value it finds in the AX register after
the call to result.  If the routine returns a 32-bit result, its
high word will be in the count member.

Ω Pget_pointer(), subroutinetypedef struct eel_pointer {    /* format of EEL pointer */≤        struct {≤                short loword, hiword;≤        } base, size, value;≤} EEL_PTR;≤≤int get_pointer(EEL_PTR *p, int segment)≤   /* for get_pointer() calls */≤#define OFFSET  0≤#define SEGMENT 1≤æ≤
The get_pointer( ) subroutine defined in lowlevel.e is helpful
if you want to pass an EEL pointer to a routine.  It takes an EEL
pointer and returns either its segment or offset, depending on
whether its second parameter is nonzero or not.  Normally, a routine
takes the segment, then the offset.

For convenience, the os2call( ) subroutine provides a nicer
interface to the do_interrupt( ) primitive.  This subroutine
loads its parameters into the global structure dllcall, then
calls do_interrupt( ).

The disk_space( ) function defined in lowlevel.e demonstrates
the use of the do_interrupt( ) primitive.  It calls OS/2 to
get information on the capacity of a disk, including how much space
is still available.

Ωdisk_space(disk, info)     /* put information on disk in info */≤        struct disk_info *info;≤{≤        struct FSAllocate fsinfo;≤≤        os2call("DOSCALLS", DOSQFSINFO, "", 5, disk, 1,≤                get_pointer(&fsinfo, SEGMENT),≤                get_pointer(&fsinfo, !SEGMENT),≤                sizeof(fsinfo), 0);≤        info->sects_per_cluster = fsinfo.sec_per_unit;≤        info->bytes_per_sector = fsinfo.bytes_sec;≤        info->avail_clusters = fsinfo.avail_units;≤        info->tot_clusters = fsinfo.num_units;≤}≤æ≤
Most OS/2 functions are in the DOSCALLS library.  The DOSQFSINFO
macro is defined as 76 in lowlevel.h, using information from the file
os2calls.doc, a human-readable version of the standard OS/2 file
os2.lib (called doscalls.lib in older versions of OS/2).  Here's how
to call a function by name, not by ordinal:

Ω Pget_pointer(), subroutineos2call("VIOCALLS", 0, "VIOWRTNATTR", ...æ

The parameters to this system call (each followed by its length in
words) are a disk number (1), a code (1), a pointer to the data
structure (2), and its size (1), for a total of 5 words.  The final
argument of 0 is a place holder and will be ignored.

The pointer must be provided to OS/2 as two short integers: the
segment and the offset.  This can be done using the subroutine
get_pointer( ).  It takes a pointer and returns either its
segment or its offset (an argument controls which).  The subroutine
works by disassembling the pointer, using the type EEL_PTR.

The EEL_PTR type is a structure representing the internal format
of an EEL pointer (except for function pointers, which are
represented as short integers internally).  An EEL pointer consists
of a base, a size, and a value.  The base and value
are standard 8086 32-bit pointers, and the size is an integer.
Epsilon compares the three fields to catch invalid pointer usage.

Whenever a function dereferences a pointer, Epsilon checks that the
fields are consistent.  That is, it makes sure that value is
greater than or equal to base, and that value is less than
base+size.  Epsilon will report an illegal dereference if
these conditions are not met.

When Epsilon constructs a pointer, it sets the base field to the
start of the block of storage within which the pointer points, and
sets the size field to the size of the block of storage, in bytes.
Epsilon then sets the value field to the actual address to which the
pointer points.  For example, if an EEL pointer p points to the
letter "c" in the string "abcd" (which is terminated by a null
byte), the size field of p will contain a 5, the base field will
point to the "a", and the value field will point to the "c".
Adding an integer to p will change only the value field.  Notice
that the modified version of p is "consistent" according to
the rules above exactly when dereferencing it would be legal: *(p
- 2), *(p - 1), *p, *(p + 1) and *(p + 2).  Also
see the ptrlen( ) primitive in Rptrlenπptrlen.

3Running a Process

 Pshell(), primitiveshell()Ωint shell(char *program, char *cline, char *buf)≤æ≤
The shell( ) primitive takes the name of an executable file (a
program) and a command line, pushes to the program, and gives it that
command line.  The primitive returns the result code of the wait()
system call, or -1 if an error occurred.  In the latter case, the
error number is in errno.

The first argument to shell( )≈shell() is the name of the actual file a
program is in, including any directory prefix.  (Under OS/2, Epsilon
will always search for a command in the current directory and then
along the PATH, so it's not necessary to provide the directory.)
The second argument to shell( ) is the command line to pass to
the program.

If the first argument to shell( ) is an empty string "",
Epsilon behaves differently.  In this case, Epsilon runs the
appropriate shell command processor.  (Note that "" is not the
same as NULL, a pointer whose value is 0.)  If the second argument is
also "", Epsilon runs the shell interactively, so that it
prompts for commands.  Otherwise, Epsilon makes the shell run only
the command line specified in the second argument.  Epsilon knows
what flags to provide to the various standard shells to make them run
interactively, or execute a single command and return, but you can
set these if necessary.  You can also set the command processor
Epsilon should use.  See Repsshellπepsshell.

When you enter a DOS command outside of Epsilon, the command
processor searches for the command by appending .com or .exe and
looking in various directories for it, but Epsilon does not provide
this service itself under DOS.  However, the command processor itself
provides a way to perform this search.  Simply execute the command
processor instead of the desired program by using "" as the
first argument, and prepend the name of the program (not including
.com or .exe) to the desired command line. The command processor will
then search for the program as usual.  For example, to get the same
result as typing

Ωcomp file1 file2æ

to the DOS command processor, use

Ωshell("", "comp file1 file2", "");æ

instead of

Ωshell("¥¥programs¥¥comp.com", "file1 file2", "");æ

(Note that you have to double the ¥ character if you want it to
appear in an EEL string.)  This technique is also necessary to
execute batch files, use internal commands like "dir", or do
command-line redirection.

The third argument to shell( ) controls whether the output of the
program is to be captured.  If "", no capturing takes place.
Otherwise the output is inserted in the specified buffer, replacing
its previous contents.

In Epsilon for Windows, when all three arguments to shell( ) are
"", Epsilon starts the program and then immediately continues
without waiting for it to finish.  If any argument is nonempty, or
in other versions, Epsilon waits for the program to finish.

Under DOS, shell( ) examines the ¬shell-shrinks≈shell-shrinks variable,
as described in Rshrinkingπshrinking.  If it's nonzero, Epsilon
moves most of itself out of memory to give the other program more
room.  Epsilon does this by copying itself to a file named eshrink
(or to EMS or XMS memory, if there's room).  The
set_shrinkname( ) primitive gives Epsilon a list of
directories to try when it creates its eshrink and eshell files.
(This primitive does nothing in non-DOS versions.)  Each time you
call set_shrinkname( ) it replaces the previous list.  Epsilon
will approximate the amount of space it needs and try each directory
on the list to find one that has enough space free.  If there are
none suitable on that list, Epsilon will try the directories on your
swap path (see Rswapfileπswapfile).  If none of these
directories has enough free space, Epsilon will ask you for a
directory.

Ωdo_push() Pdo_push(), subroutineint do_push(char *cmdline, int cap, int show)≤æ≤
The do_push( ) subroutine is a convenient way to call
shell( ).  It uses the command processor to execute a command
line (so the command line may contain redirection characters and the
like).  If cap is nonzero, the subroutine will capture the output
of the command to the process buffer.  If show is nonzero, the
subroutine will arrange to show the output to the user.  How it does
this depends on cap.  To show captured output, Epsilon displays
the process buffer after the program finishes.  To show non-captured
output, Epsilon (non-GUI versions only) waits for the user to
press a key after the program finishes, before restoring Epsilon's
screen.  If show is -1, Epsilon skips this step.

This subroutine interprets the variable
start-process-in-buffer-directory and takes care of displaying
an error to the user if the process couldn't be run.

4Concurrent Process Primitives

 Pconcur_shell(), primitiveconcur_shell()Ωint concur_shell(char *program, char *cline, ?char *curdir, char *buf)≤short another_process();≤int is_process_buffer(int buf)≤æ≤
The concur_shell( ) primitive also takes a program and a
command line, with the same rules as the shell( )≈shell() primitive.
It starts a concurrent process, with input and output connected to
the buffer "process", just like the ¬start-process command
described in Rstartprocessπstartprocess does.  If you specify a
buffer buf, it starts the process in that buffer.  (Some versions
of Epsilon support only one process buffer; in them the buffer name,
if specified, must be "process".)  If you specify a directory name
in curdir, Epsilon starts the process with that current directory.
The primitive returns 0 if it could start the process.  If it
couldn't, it returns an error code.

Under DOS, a concurrent process runs only when Epsilon is waiting for
you to press a key.  The process does not run at any other time
(except during a delay( )--see Rdelayπdelay).  In other
environments, Epsilon only receives process output and sends it input
at such times, but the process otherwise runs independently.

another_process() Panother_process(), primitiveThe another_process( ) primitive returns the number of
active concurrent processes.

is_process_buffer()MISPROC_CONCURMISPROC_PIPE Pis_process_buffer(), primitive PISPROC_CONCUR, textual macro PISPROC_PIPE, textual macroThe is_process_buffer( ) primitive returns
ISPROC_CONCUR if the specified buffer holds an active
concurrent process, ISPROC_PIPE if the buf_pipe_text( )
primitive is sending output into it, or 0 if no concurrent process is
associated with that buffer.

Ωuser buffer int type_point;≤æ≤
Characters from the process go into the process buffer at a certain
position that we call the ªtype pointº.  The type_point≈type_point
variable stores this position.

When a process tries to read a character of input, Epsilon stops the
process until there is at least one character following the type
point, and when the process tries to read a line of input, Epsilon
does not run the process until a newline appears in the section of
the buffer after the type point.  When a concurrent process is
started by the concur_shell( ) primitive, the type point is
initially set to the value of point in the specified buffer.

Internet commands for Telnet and FTP use type_point much like
a process buffer does, to determine where to insert text into a
buffer and where to read any text to be sent.

Ωprocess_input()MPROCESS_INPUT_LINEMPROCESS_INPUT_CHARconcur_activity() Pprocess_input(), primitive PPROCESS_INPUT_LINE, textual macro PPROCESS_INPUT_CHAR, textual macro Pconcur_activity(), subroutineint process_input(?int buf)≤#define PROCESS_INPUT_LINE  1≤#define PROCESS_INPUT_CHAR  2≤buffer int (*when_activity)();≤concur_handler(int activity, int buf, int from, int to)≤æ≤
The process_input( ) primitive returns
PROCESS_INPUT_LINE if the process is waiting for a
character, PROCESS_INPUT_CHAR if the process is waiting for
a line of input, and 0 if the process is running or there is no
process.  It operates on the the buffer named "process" if no
buffer number is specified.

Whenever Epsilon receives process output or sends it input, it calls
an EEL function.  The buffer-specific ¬when_activity≈when_activity
variable contains a function pointer to the function to call.  If the
variable is zero in a buffer, Epsilon won't call any EEL function as
it proceeds.  For a typical process buffer, the when_activity
variable points to the concur_activity( ) subroutine.

 PNET_RECV, textual macro Pconcur_activity(), subroutineJust after a concurrent process inserts output in a process buffer,
it calls this subroutine, passing πMNET_RECV as the activity.
The from and to parameters mark the range of buffer text that
was just received from the process.  The concur_activity( )
subroutine responds to this message by coloring the inserted
characters with the color_class process_output color, and similar
tasks.

 PNET_SEND, textual macroEpsilon calls this subroutine and passes πMNET_SEND when it
detects that the concurrent process is now ready for input, and again
as it sends the input to the process.  When the process becomes ready
for input, the subroutine will be called
with a from parameter of zero.  When the process is sent a line
of text, the subroutine will be called with a from of
PROCESS_INPUT_LINE, and when the process is sent a single
character it will be called with a from of
PROCESS_INPUT_CHAR.  In each case the to parameter will
indicate the beginning of the input text (the value of
type_point before the input begins).

MPROC_STATUS_RUNNING PNET_DONE, textual macro PPROC_STATUS_RUNNING, textual macroEpsilon calls this subroutine and passes πMNET_DONE when the
process exits.  Its from parameter will hold the exit code, or 0
if Epsilon didn't record this.  Epsilon sets the buffer-specific
¬process_exit_status≈process_exit_status variable to the value
PROC_STATUS_RUNNING when a process starts, and sets it to
the process exit status (or 0) when the process exits.

Epsilon for Unix often cannot detect when a process is awaiting
input.  Therefore process_input( ) always returns zero, and a
πMNET_SEND activity will typically not be signaled with a
from parameter of zero.

Ωhalt_process() Phalt_process(), primitiveint halt_process(?int hard_kill, int buf)≤æ≤
The halt_process( ) primitive has the same function as the
¬stop-process command.  A value of 0 for hard_kill
makes the primitive act the same as stop-process with no
argument.  Otherwise, it is equivalent to stop-process with
an argument.  The function returns 1 if it succeeds, and 0 if
it cannot signal the process for some reason.  The argument is
ignored in the non-DOS versions, since there is only one method for
aborting a process.  It operates on the the buffer named "process"
if no buffer number is specified.

Ωprocess_kill() Pprocess_kill(), primitiveint process_kill(?int buf)≤æ≤
In Epsilon for Windows and Epsilon for Unix, the
process_kill( ) primitive disconnects Epsilon from a running
concurrent process, telling it to exit.  The function returns 1
if it succeeds, and 0 if it cannot kill the process for some
reason.  It operates on the the buffer named "process" if no buffer
number is specified.

4Other Process Primitives

 PPIPE_SYNCH, textual macro Ppipe_text(), subroutineMPIPE_SYNCHpipe_text()Ωint pipe_text(char *input, char *output, char *cmdline, char *curdir,≤              int flags, int handler)≤my_handler(int activity, int buf, int from, int to)  // Sample.≤int buf_pipe_text(int inputb, int outputb, char *cmdline,≤                  char *curdir, int flags)≤æ≤
The pipe_text( ) subroutine runs the program specified by
cmdline, passing it the contents of a buffer as its standard input, and
inserting its standard output into a second buffer (or the same buffer).

Either the input or output buffer names may be NULL.  Epsilon provides a
current directory of curdir, or uses Epsilon's current directory if
curdir is NULL or "".  The subroutine returns 0 and sets
errno if the function could not be started, or returns 1 if the
function started successfully.

The PIPE_SYNCH flag means don't return from the subroutine until
the process has finished.  Otherwise, Epsilon starts the subprocess and then
returns from pipe_text( ), letting the subprocess run asynchronously.

MPIPE_CLEAR_BUF PPIPE_CLEAR_BUF, textual macroThe PIPE_CLEAR_BUF flag means empty the output buffer before
inserting the process's text (but do nothing if the process can't be
started); it's convenient when the input and output buffers are the same, to
filter a buffer in place.

MPIPE_NOREFRESH PPIPE_NOREFRESH, textual macroThe PIPE_NOREFRESH flag tells Epsilon not to refresh the screen
each time more data is received from the process, and is most useful with
PIPE_SYNCH if you don't want the user to see the data until after it's
been processed.

 PNET_RECV, textual macro PNET_DONE, textual macroIf handler is nonzero, it's the index of a function (or a
function pointer) to call each time text is received from the
process, and when the process terminates.  You must specify an output
buffer for a handler to be called.  The handler function will be
called with the buffer number into which more process output has just
been inserted, and from and to set to indicate the new text.
The parameter activity will be πMNET_RECV when characters
have been received, or πMNET_DONE when the subprocess has
exited.  In the latter case from will hold the process exit code.

 PPROC_STATUS_RUNNING, textual macroEpsilon sets the buffer-specific ¬process-exit-status≈process-exit-status
variable to the value πMPROC_STATUS_RUNNING when a process
starts, and sets it to the process exit status (or 0) when the
process exits.

buf_pipe_text() Pbuf_pipe_text(), primitiveThe pipe_text( ) subroutine described above is implemented using the
buf_pipe_text( ) primitive.  There are a few differences between
these:

The buf_pipe_text( ) primitive uses buffer numbers, not buffer names.  It
won't create a buffer for you the way the subroutine will; the buffer must
already exist.  (Pass 0 for a buffer number if you don't need input or
output.)

when_activity Vwhen_activity, buffer-specific variableInstead of passing a function pointer for handler, you must instead set
the buffer-specific when_activity variable in the output buffer
prior to calling buf_pipe_text( ).

Pass a curdir of "", not NULL, to buf_pipe_text( ) to use
Epsilon's current directory.

The pipe_text( ) and buf_pipe_text( ) functions are only available
in Epsilon for Unix and Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT.

Ωwinexec() Pwinexec(), primitiveint winexec(char *prog, char *cmdline, int show, int wait)≤/* Pass these values to winexec: */≤#define SW_HIDE             0≤#define SW_SHOWNORMAL       1≤#define SW_SHOWMINIMIZED    2≤#define SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED    3≤#define SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE   4≤#define SW_SHOW             5≤#define SW_MINIMIZE         6≤#define SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE  7≤#define SW_SHOWNA           8≤#define SW_RESTORE          9≤æ≤
In Epsilon for Windows, the winexec( ) primitive runs a
program, like the shell( ) primitive, but provides a different
set of options.  Normally, the second parameter to winexec( )
contains the command line to execute and the first parameter contains
the name of the program to execute.  With some versions of Windows
and some types of executables, you can provide "" as the program
to execute, and Windows will determine the correct program name from
the command line.

The third parameter to winexec( ) specifies the window visibility
state for the new program.  It can be one of the values listed above.
If the fourth parameter is nonzero, Epsilon will wait for the program
to finish before returning from the winexec( ) primitive.  If the
fourth parameter is zero, the primitive will return immediately.

This primitive returns the exit code of the program it ran.  If an
error prevented it from running the program, it returns -1 and
puts an error code in the global variable errno.  When the
primitive runs a program without waiting for it to finish, the
primitive returns zero if the program started successfully.

Ωrun_viewer() Prun_viewer(), primitiveint run_viewer(char *file, char *action, char *dir)≤æ≤
The run_viewer( ) primitive runs the program associated with
the given file, using its Windows file association.  The most common
action is "Open", though a program may define others, such as
"Print".  The dir parameter specifies the current directory
in which to run the program.  The primitive returns nonzero if it was
successful, or zero if it could not run the program or the program
returned an error code.  This primitive always returns zero in the
non-Windows versions of Epsilon.

2Control Primitives
3Control Flow

 Pquick_abort(), primitive Pwhen_aborting(), subroutine Perror(), primitivequick_abort()when_aborting()error()RabortingΩerror(char *format, ...)≤when_aborting()       /* control.e */≤quick_abort()≤æ≤
Epsilon provides several primitives for altering the
flow of control from one statement to the next.  The
error( ) primitive takes arguments like say( )≈say(),
displays the string as say( )≈say() does, and then aborts the current
command, returning to the main loop (see Rloopπloop).  In
addition this primitive discards any type-ahead and calls the
user-defined subroutine when_aborting( ) if it exists.  The
standard version of when_aborting( ) optionally rings the bell
and removes the erroneous command from any keyboard macro being
defined.  The primitive quick_abort( ) acts like
error( )≈error() but displays no message.

Ωcheck_abort() Pcheck_abort(), primitiveuser char user_abort;≤short abort_key;≤check_abort()≤æ≤
The variable user_abort≈user_abort is normally 0.  It is set to
1 when you press the key whose value is abort_key≈abort_key.  To
disable the abort key, set abort_key to -1.  By default,
the abort_key≈abort_key variable is set to Control-G.  Use the
set-abort-key command to set the abort_key variable.
Additionally, under DOS the ⁄Scroll Lock€ key is always bound to
abort, and under OS/2, Ctrl-⁄Scroll Lock€'s A option acts
like abort.  See Rabortcmdπabortcmd.

The primitive check_abort( ) calls error( )≈error() with the
argument "Canceled." if the variable user_abort≈user_abort is
nonzero.  Use the primitive check_abort( )≈check_abort() whenever a command
can be safely aborted, since otherwise an abort will only happen when
the command returns.  Epsilon calls check_abort( ) internally
during any searching operation (see Rabortsearchingπabort-searching),
when you use the delay( ) primitive (described below) to wait, or
(optionally) during certain file matching primitives (see Rabortfilematchingπabort-file-matching).

Ωleave()when_exiting() Pleave(), primitive Pwhen_exiting(), subroutineleave(?int exitcode)≤when_exiting()              /* EEL subroutine */≤æ≤
The primitive leave( ) exits Epsilon with the specified exit
code (or 0 if omitted).  Under DOS, it does nothing if a process
is running.

Just before calling leave( ), Epsilon's standard commands call
the when_exiting( ) subroutine.  By default, this does
nothing, but you can replace it to customize Epsilon's behavior at
this time.  (See Rmultipleπmultiple to make sure your extension
doesn't interfere with other extensions.)

ΩRdelaydelay()MCOND_KEYMCOND_PROC Pdelay(), primitive PCOND_KEY, textual macro PCOND_PROC, textual macrodelay(int hundredths, int condition)≤æ≤
The delay( ) primitive takes an argument
specifying a period of time, in hundredths of a second, and a bit
pattern specifying additional conditions (with codes specified in
codes.h).  It waits until one of the conditions occurs, or until the
specified time limit is reached.  A time limit of -1 means to
wait forever.

The condition code COND_KEY makes Epsilon return when a key
is pressed.  The condition code COND_PROC makes Epsilon
return when a concurrent process is waiting for input.  (This
function varies a bit from one operating system to another.  For
example, some versions of Epsilon may return whenever the user
presses a key, regardless of the presence of the COND_KEY
flag.)  Also see the timing functions in Rtimingπtiming.

ΩRexitrecurdo_recursion()leave_recursion() Pdo_recursion(), primitive Pleave_recursion(), primitiveint do_recursion()≤leave_recursion(int val)≤int recursive_edit() /* control.e */≤char _recursion_level;≤æ≤
The do_recursion( ) primitive starts a new
loop for getting characters and interpreting them as commands.  A
recursive edit preserves the current values of the variables
has_arg≈has_arg, iter≈iter, this_cmd≈this_cmd, and prev_cmd≈prev_cmd,
but does not preserve the current buffer, window, or anything else.
(See Rloopπloop.)  Exit the recursion by calling the
leave_recursion( ) primitive.  It arranges for the main loop to
exit, instead of waiting for another key to be executed.  The call to
do_recursion() will then return with a value of val, the
argument of the call to leave_recursion( ).

Sometimes a recursive edit is done "secretly," and the user
doesn't know that one is being used.  For example, when Epsilon reads
the name of a file using completion, it's actually doing a recursive
edit.  Keys like ⁄Space€ exit the recursive edit with a special
code, and the function that did the recursive edit displays a menu,
or whatever is needed, and then does another recursive edit.

recursive_edit()_recursion_level Precursive_edit(), subroutine V_recursion_level, variableOther times (typing Ctrl-R in query-replace, for example),
the user is supposed to exit the recursive edit explicitly using the
¬exit-level command.  When you're supposed to use
exit-level to exit, Epsilon displays extra [ ]'s in the
mode line as a reminder.  The recursive_edit( ) subroutine does
a recursive edit, and arranges for these [ ]'s to appear by
modifying the _recursion_level variable.  It contains the
number of extra [ ]'s to display.  The recursive_edit( )
subroutine returns the value returned by do_recursion( ).

If you call leave_recursion( ) when there has been no matching
do_recursion( ), Epsilon automatically invokes the command
¬exit.  If exit returns instead of calling the
primitive leave( )≈leave(), Epsilon begins its main loop again.

Ωsetjmp() Psetjmp(), primitiveint setjmp(jmp_buf *location)≤longjmp(jmp_buf *location, int value)≤æ≤
Epsilon implements aborting by two special primitives that allow
jumping from a function to another point in that function or any of
the functions that called it.  The setjmp( ) primitive marks
the place to return, storing the location in a variable declared like
this:

Ωlongjmp() Plongjmp(), primitivejmp_buf location;æ

After calling setjmp( )≈setjmp() with a pointer to this structure, you
can return to this place in the code at any time until this function
returns by calling the longjmp( ) primitive.  The first argument
is a pointer to the same structure, and the second argument may be
any nonzero value.

The first time setjmp( )≈setjmp() is called, it returns a zero value.
Each time longjmp( )≈longjmp() is called, Epsilon acts as if it is
returning from the original setjmp( )≈setjmp() call again, returning the
second argument from the longjmp( )≈longjmp().  For example:

Ωone()≤{≤jmp_buf location;≤≤if (setjmp(&location)){≤        stuff("Back in one¥n");≤        return;≤} else≤        stuff("Ready to go¥n");≤two(&location);≤}≤≤two(loc)≤jmp_buf *loc;≤{≤stuff("In two¥n");≤longjmp(loc, 1);≤stuff("Never get here¥n");≤}≤æ≤
This example inserts the lines

ΩReady to go≤In two≤Back in one≤æ≤
≤Ωtop_level Ptop_level, primitivejmp_buf *top_level;≤æ≤
The error( )≈error() primitive uses the jump buffer pointed to
by the top_level variable.  If you wish to get control when
the user presses the abort key, temporarily change the value of
top_level≈top_level to refer to another jump buffer.  Make sure you
restore it, however, or subsequent aborting may not work.

3Character Types

 Pisalpha(), primitive Pisdigit(), primitive Pisspace(), primitiveisalpha()isdigit()isspace()Ωislower()isupper() Pislower(), primitive Pisupper(), primitiveint isspace(int ch)≤int isdigit(int ch)≤int isalpha(int ch)≤int islower(int ch)≤int isupper(int ch)≤int isalnum(int ch)  /* basic.e */≤int isident(int ch)  /* basic.e */≤int any_uppercase(char *p)≤æ≤
Epsilon has several primitives that are helpful for determining if a
character is in a certain class.  The isspace( ) primitive tells
if its character argument is a space, tab, or newline character.  It
returns 1 if it is, otherwise 0.

In the same way, the isdigit( ) primitive tells if a character
is a digit (one of the characters 0 through 9), and the
isalpha( ) primitive tells if the character is a letter.  The
islower( ) and isupper( ) primitives tell if the character
is a lower case letter or upper case letter, respectively.

isalnum()isident() Pisalnum(), subroutine Pisident(), subroutineThe isalnum( ) subroutine returns nonzero if the specified character
is alphanumeric: either a letter or a digit.  The isident( )
subroutine returns nonzero if the specified character is an identifier
character: a letter, a digit, or the _ character.

any_uppercase() Pany_uppercase(), subroutineThe any_uppercase( ) subroutine returns nonzero if there are
any upper case characters in its string argument p.

Ωtolower()toupper() Ptolower(), primitive Ptoupper(), primitiveint tolower(int ch)≤int toupper(int ch)≤æ≤
The tolower( ) primitive converts an upper case letter to the
corresponding lower case letter.  It returns a character that is not
an upper case letter unchanged.  The toupper( ) primitive
converts a lower case letter to its upper case equivalent, and leaves
other characters unchanged.

ΩRcasematch_case_map_char_classMC_LOWERMC_UPPER V_case_map, buffer-specific variable V_char_class, buffer-specific variable PC_LOWER, textual macro PC_UPPER, textual macrobuffer char *_case_map;≤buffer char *_char_class;≤æ≤
Epsilon uses the buffer-specific variables
_case_map and _char_class internally when it
needs to determine if a particular character is an upper case or
lower case letter, or convert a character to upper case or lower
case.  The _case_map variable is a pointer to an array of 256
characters.  It maps a character to its equivalent in the opposite
case (or to itself if there is none).  For example,
_case_map['a'] is "A" and _case_map['Z'] is "z".

The _char_class≈_char_class buffer-specific variable is also a pointer to
an array of 256 characters.  In this case, each character holds a bit
pattern.  The bit codes are defined in eel.h: C_LOWER
indicates a lower case letter and C_UPPER indicates an upper
case letter.  Epsilon initializes both arrays in the file epsilon.e
to reflect the characters normally available.  Since these variables
are buffer-specific pointers, you can have each buffer use a
different rule for case conversion and testing.  Epsilon uses these
arrays only for character testing and conversion, not for case
folding during searching, sorting or other character comparisons.
See Rsrchmapπsrchmap for information on case folding.

Ωget_direction() Pget_direction(), subroutineint get_direction()         /* window.e */≤æ≤
The get_direction( ) subroutine converts the last key pressed
into a direction.  It understands arrow keys, as well as the
equivalent control characters.  It returns πMBTOP, πMBBOTTOM,
πMBLEFT, πMBRIGHT, or -1 if the key doesn't correspond to
any direction.

3Strings

 Pstrncpy(), primitive Pstrcpy(), primitive Pstrlen(), primitivestrncpy()strcpy()strlen()Ωint strlen(char *s)≤æ≤
Epsilon provides various primitives for manipulating strings, or
equivalently, zero-terminated arrays of characters.  The
strlen( ) primitive returns the length of a string.  That is, it
tells the position in the array of the first zero character.

Ωstrcpy(char *tostr, char *fromstr)≤strncpy(char *tostr, char *fromstr, int count)≤æ≤
The strcpy( ) primitive copies the null-terminated string
fromstr to the array at tostr, including the terminating null
character.  The strncpy( ) primitive does the same, but
always stops when count characters have been transferred, adding
an additional null character to the string at tostr if necessary.

Ωstrcat()strncat() Pstrcat(), primitive Pstrncat(), primitivestrcat(char *tostr, char *fromstr)≤strncat(char *tostr, char *fromstr, int count)≤æ≤
The strcat( ) primitive concatenates (or appends) the string at
fromstr after the string at tostr.  For example, if
fromstr points at the constant string "def" and tostr
is an array of 10 characters that contains "abc" (and then, of
course, a null character, plus 6 more characters with any value),
then strcat(tostr, fromstr); makes the array tostr
contain "abcdef" followed by a null character and 3 unused
characters.

The strncat( ) primitive works similarly.  It appends at most
count characters from fromstr, and ensures that the
result is zero-terminated by adding a null character if necessary.
Note that the count limits the number of characters appended, not the
total number of characters in the string.

Ωstrcmp()strncmp() Pstrcmp(), primitive Pstrncmp(), primitiveint strcmp(char *first, char *second)≤int strncmp(char *first, char *second, int count)≤æ≤
The strcmp( ) primitive tells if two strings are identical.  It
returns 0 if all characters in them are the same (and if they have
the same length).  Otherwise, it returns a negative number if the
lexicographic ordering of these strings would put the first before
the second.  It returns a positive number otherwise.  The
strncmp( ) primitive is like strcmp( )≈strcmp(), except
only the first count characters matter.

Ωint strfcmp(char *first, char *second)≤int strnfcmp(char *first, char *second, int count)≤int charfcmp(int first, int second)≤æ≤
Epsilon also has similar comparison primitives that consider
upper case and lower case letters to be equal.  The strfcmp( )≈strfcmp()
primitive acts like strcmp( )≈strcmp() and the strnfcmp( )≈strnfcmp()
primitive acts like strncmp( )≈strncmp(), but if the buffer-specific
variable ¬case_fold≈case_fold is nonzero, Epsilon folds characters in the
same way searching or sorting would before making the comparison.
The charfcmp( )≈charfcmp() primitive takes two characters and performs the
same comparison on them.  For characters »a… and »b…,
charfcmp('»a…', '»b…') equals strfcmp("»a…",
"»b…").  See Rsrchmapπsrchmap for information on how to
change Epsilon's rules for case-folding.

Ωmemcmp()memfcmp()memcpy() Pmemcmp(), primitive Pmemfcmp(), primitive Pmemcpy(), primitiveint memcmp(char *str1, char *str2, int num)≤int memfcmp(char *str1, char *str2, int num)≤memcpy(char *tostr, char *fromstr, int num)≤memset(char *ptr, char value, int count)≤æ≤
The memcmp( ) primitive works like strcmp( ), except that
it makes no assumptions about zero-termination.  It takes two strings
and a size, then compares that many characters from each string.  If
the strings exactly match, memcmp( ) returns zero.  If str1
would be alphabetically before str2, it returns a negative value.
If str2 would be alphabetically before str1, it returns a
positive value.

Similarly, the memfcmp( ) primitive works like
strnfcmp( ), except that it makes no assumptions about
zero-termination.  Whereas the latter two will stop comparing when it
reaches a zero byte, the former will not.

The memcpy( ) primitive copies exactly num characters
from the second character array to the first.

memset() Pmemset(), primitiveThe memset( ) primitive sets all the count characters in
a character array ptr to the given value.

Ωindex()rindex()strstr() Pindex(), primitive Prindex(), primitive Pstrstr(), primitivechar *index(char *s, int ch)≤char *rindex(char *s, int ch)≤char *strstr(char *s, char *t)≤æ≤
The index( ) primitive tells if a character ch appears in
the string s.  It returns a pointer to the first appearance of
ch, or a null pointer if there is none.  The rindex( )
primitive works the same, but returns a pointer to the last appearance
of ch.

The strstr( ) primitive searches the string s for a copy
of the string t.  It returns a pointer to the first appearance
of t, or a null pointer if there is none.  It case-folds as
described above for strfcmp( ).

Ωfpatmatch() Pfpatmatch(), primitiveint fpatmatch(char *s, char *pat, int prefix, int fold)≤æ≤
The fpatmatch( ) primitive returns nonzero if a string s
matches a pattern pat.  It uses a simple filename-style pattern
syntax: * matches any number of characters; ? matches a
single character, and [a-z] match a character class (with the
same character class syntax as other patterns in Epsilon).  If
prefix is nonzero, s must begin with text matching pat;
otherwise pat must match all of s.  If fold is nonzero,
Epsilon folds characters before comparing according to the current
buffer's folding rules.

Ωsprintf() Psprintf(), primitiveint sprintf(char *dest, char *format, ...)≤æ≤
The sprintf( ) primitive is the most powerful string building
primitive Epsilon provides.  It takes two or more arguments.  The
first is a character array.  The remaining arguments are in the
format that say( )≈say() uses: a format string possibly followed by
more arguments.  (See Rprintfπprintf.)  Instead of printing
the string that is built on the screen, it copies the string into the
destination array, and returns the number of characters copied.

3Memory Allocation

 Pfree(), primitive Prealloc(), primitive Pmalloc(), primitivefree()realloc()malloc()Ωchar *malloc(int size)≤char *realloc(char *ptr, int size)≤free(char *ptr)≤æ≤
Epsilon maintains a pool of memory and provides primitives for
allocating and deallocating blocks of any size.  The malloc( )
primitive takes an int giving the number of bytes of space required,
and returns a pointer to a block of that size.

The realloc( ) primitive takes a pointer previously allocated
with malloc( ).  First, it tries to expand the block to the
requested size.  If it cannot do that, it allocates another block of
the requested size, then copies the old characters to the new block.
In either case, it returns a pointer to a block of the requested
size.

The free( ) primitive takes a pointer that malloc( )≈malloc()
previously returned and puts it back into the storage pool.  Never
use a block after you free it.

ΩRstrsavestrsave() Pstrsave(), primitivechar *strsave(char *s)≤æ≤
For convenience, Epsilon provides a primitive to copy
a string to an allocated block of the proper size.  The
strsave( ) primitive is used when a string needed later is
stored in an array that must be reused.  The primitive returns a
pointer to the copy of the string it makes.  The free( )≈free()
primitive may be given this pointer when the string is no longer
needed.

Ωuser int availmem;≤user int mem_in_use;≤æ≤
The total amount of memory available to Epsilon for DOS is in the
availmem≈availmem variable.  This includes the space for a process.
Under other operating systems, this value is simply a meaningless big
number.  The mem_in_use≈mem_in_use variable gives the space in bytes
Epsilon is now using for miscellaneous storage (not including buffer
text).

Ωset_swapname() Pset_swapname(), primitive F-fs, command line flagset_swapname(char *path)≤æ≤
If Epsilon can't fit all your files in available memory, it will swap
parts to disk.  The parts are contained in one or more swap files.
The set_swapname( ) primitive tells Epsilon what directories to
use for swap files, if it needs them.  The argument is a string
containing a list of ªdirectoriesº in which to place swap files, as
described under the -fs command line flag.  After swapping has begun,
this primitive has no effect.  Supplying an empty argument ""
makes Epsilon use the standard place for swapping, as described under
the -fs command line switch in Rswapfileπswapfile.

3The Name Table

 Pfinal_index(), primitivename tablefinal_index()Rname-tableΩint final_index()≤æ≤
Epsilon keeps track of all EEL
variables, commands, subroutines, key tables, color schemes, and
keyboard macros in its ªname tableº.  Each of these items has an
entry there that lists its name, type, value, and additional
information.  An EEL program can access the table using a numeric
index, like an array index.  The first valid index to the name table
is 1, and the final_index( ) primitive returns the last valid
index.  The index is based on the order in which the names were
defined.

All variables appear in the name table, including primitive
variables.  Primitive functions (like most of those defined in this
chapter) and EEL's #define textual macros are not in the name
table.  A state file contains an exact copy of a name table (plus
some additional information).

Each entry contains the name of the item, a type code, a
debugging flag, a help file offset, and whatever information Epsilon
needs internally to make use of the item.  When executing an EEL
program, Epsilon automatically uses the table to find the value of a
variable, for example, or execute a command.  You can
manipulate the table with EEL functions.

Ωfind_index()function, pointer tokey table, values incast, function pointershort, eel keywordpointer to functionkeytable, values in Pfind_index(), primitiveint find_index(char *name)≤æ≤

There are two ways to get
an index if you have the name of an item.  The find_index( ) primitive
takes an item name as a string and returns the index of that item, or
0 if there is no such item.  If the item is an EEL command or
subroutine, casting its function pointer to a short also yields the
index.  For example, (short) forward_word gives the index of the
command forward-word if forward_word() has been declared
previously in the source file the expression appears in.

Ωname_name()name_type() PNT_COMMAND, textual macro PNT_SUBR, textual macro Pname_name(), primitive Pname_type(), primitive PNT_MACRO, textual macro PNT_TABLE, textual macro PNT_VAR, textual macro PNT_BUFVAR, textual macro PNT_WINVAR, textual macro PNT_COLSCHEME, textual macrochar *name_name(int index)≤int name_type(int index)      /* codes: */≤#define NT_COMMAND     1      /* normal bytecode function */≤#define NT_SUBR        2      /* hidden bytecode function */≤#define NT_MACRO       3      /* keyboard macro */≤#define NT_TABLE       4      /* key table */≤#define NT_VAR         5      /* normal variable */≤#define NT_BUFVAR      6      /* buffer-specific variable */≤#define NT_WINVAR      7      /* window-specific variable */≤#define NT_COLSCHEME   8      /* color scheme */≤#define NT_AUTOLOAD     10    /* load cmd from file */≤#define NT_AUTOSUBR     11    /* load subr from file */≤æ≤
The primitives
name_name( ) and name_type( ) return the name and
type of a
table
entry, respectively.  They each take an index into the name table and
return the desired information.  The value returned by
name_name( ) is only valid until the next call to this function.
Copy the name if you want to preserve it.

The codes for name_type( ) are in the standard include file
codes.h.

Ωtry_calling() Ptry_calling(), primitiveint try_calling(char *name)≤æ≤
The try_calling( ) primitive calls a subroutine or command if it
exists and doesn't complain if the function does not exist.  It takes
the name of the function to call.  It returns 0 if the function doesn't
exist.  The function it calls must not require arguments.

Ωdrop_name() Pdrop_name(), primitiveint drop_name(char *name)≤æ≤
To delete an item from the name table, use the drop_name( )
primitive.  It returns 0 if it deleted the name, 1 if there
was no such name in the name table, and 2 if there was such a
name but it couldn't be deleted because it is currently in use.

Ωreplace_name()Rmultiple Preplace_name(), primitiveint replace_name(char *old, char *new)≤æ≤
The replace_name( ) primitive renames an item in the name
table.  It returns 0 if the name change was successful, 1
if the original name did not exist, and 2 if the name change was
unsuccessful because another item had the new name already.  Any
references to the original item result in an error, unless you
provide a new definition for it later.

Sometimes when writing an Epsilon extension, you may wish to redefine
one of Epsilon's built-in subroutines (getkey( ), for example)
to do something in addition to its usual action.  You can, of
course, simply modify the definition of the function, adding whatever
you want.  Unfortunately, if someone else gives you an extension that
modifies the same function, it will overwrite your version.  You'll
have the same problem when you get a new version of Epsilon--you'll
have to merge your change by hand.

ΩMREPLACE_FUNC() PREPLACE_FUNC(), textual macro Pstart_up(), subroutine#define REPLACE_FUNC(ext, func)  ....≤        /* definition omitted */≤æ≤
Alternatively, you can create an extension that modifies the existing
version of a function, even if it's already been modified.  The trick
is to replace it with a function that calls the original function.
This can be done from a when_loading( ) function by using the
replace_name( )≈replace_name() and drop_name( )≈drop_name() primitives, but
eel.h defines a macro that does all of this.  The
REPLACE_FUNC() macro takes the name of the extension you're
writing, and the name of the existing subroutine you want to replace.
It doesn't really matter what the extension name is, just so long as
no other extension uses it.

Here's an example.  Suppose you're writing an extension that displays
"Hello, world" whenever you start Epsilon.  You've decided to name
the extension "hello", and you want Epsilon's start_up( )
function to do the work.  Here's what you do:

Ωnew_hello_start_up()    /* will be renamed to start_up */≤{≤   say("Hello, world");≤   hello_start_up(); /* call old (which will have this name) */≤}≤≤REPLACE_FUNC("hello", "start-up")≤æ≤
Notice the steps: first you have to define a function with a name of
the form
new_∑p<extension-name>∏p_∑p<replaced-function-name>∏p.
Make sure it calls a function named
∑p<extension-name>∏p_∑p<replaced-function-name>∏p.
Then do the πMREPLACE_FUNC( ), providing the two names.  This will
rename the current ∑p<replaced-function-name>∏p to
∑p<extension-name>∏p_∑p<replaced-function-name>∏p,
then rename your function to ∑p<replaced-function-name>∏p.

3Built-in and User Variables

 PNT_BUILTVAR, textual macroMNT_BUILTVARVariables that are automatically defined by Epsilon, and have no
definition in eel.h, are called built-in variables.  These include
point, bufnum, and most of the primitive variables
described in this chapter.  All such built-in variables have entries
in Epsilon's name table, so that you can see and set them using
commands like set-variable or set-any-variable.
Built-in variables have a name_type( ) code of
NT_BUILTVAR.

Ωget_num_var()get_str_var()set_num_var()set_str_var() Pget_num_var(), primitive Pget_str_var(), primitive Pset_num_var(), primitive Pset_str_var(), primitiveint get_num_var(int i)≤set_num_var(int i, int value)≤≤char *get_str_var(int i)≤set_str_var(int i, char *value)≤æ≤
Epsilon has several primitives that let you get and set the value of
numeric and string global variables (including both built-in and
ordinary, user-defined variables).  Each primitive takes a name table
index i.  The get_num_var( ) and get_str_var( )
primitives return the numeric or string value (respectively) of the
indicated variable, while the set_num_var( ) and
set_str_var( ) primitives set the variable.  If you provide
an index that doesn't refer to a variable of the correct type, the
setting functions do nothing, while the getting functions return
zero.  (See the vartype( ) primitive below.)  The string
functions only operate on variables with a character pointer data
type, not on character arrays.  Use varptr( ) below to modify
character arrays.

when_setting_ subroutinesThe ¬set-variable command and similar functions
look for and try to call a function named
when_setting_»varname…() after setting a variable named
»varname….  For most variables a function with that name
doesn't exist, and nothing happens.  The want-code-coloring
variable is an example of a variable with a when_setting()
function.  Its when_setting() function sets various other
variables to match want-code-coloring's new value.

Any user attempts to set a variable (such as running
¬set-variable or loading a command file) will call such a
function, but an ordinary assignment statement in an EEL function
will not.  If you write an EEL function that sets a variable with a
when_setting() function, you should call the function explicitly
after setting the variable.

ΩRusername_user()set_name_user() Pname_user(), primitive Pset_name_user(), primitiveint name_user(int i)≤set_name_user(int i, int is_user)≤æ≤
For each global variable, built-in or not, Epsilon
records whether or not it is a "user" variable.  Some commands such
as set-variable only show user variables.  Otherwise, Epsilon
treats user variables the same as others.  The name_user( )
primitive returns non-zero if the variable with the given name table
index is a user variable, and the set_name_user( ) primitive
sets whether a variable with a particular name table index is a user
variable.

Ω Euser, EEL keyworduser int my_var;        // sample declaration≤æ≤
By default, variables you declare with EEL are all non-user
variables, hidden from the user.  If the user is supposed to set a
variable directly in order to alter a command's behavior, put the
user keyword before its global variable definition to make
it a user variable.  (In previous versions, Epsilon used a convention
that any non-user variables you defined had to start with an
underscore character, and all others were effectively user variables.
This convention still works: set-variable will still exclude
such variables from normal completion lists.)

Ωptrlen()Rptrlen Pptrlen(), primitiveint ptrlen(char *p)≤æ≤
The ptrlen( ) primitive takes a pointer of any type and returns
the size in bytes of the object it points to.  The value of
ptrlen(p) is the lowest value i for which ((char *)p)[i]
is an illegal dereference.

Ωvarptr() Pvarptr(), primitivechar *varptr(int i)≤æ≤
The varptr( ) primitive returns a pointer to any global
variable given its index in the name table.  The pointer is always a
character pointer and should be cast to the correct type before it's
used.  When varptr( )≈varptr() is applied to a buffer-specific or
window-specific variable, Epsilon checks the use_default
variable to determine if a pointer to the default or current value
should be returned (see Rusedefaultπusedefault).  This function
doesn't operate with built-in variables--use get_num_var( ) and
similar functions for these.

Ωvartype()MTYPE_POINTER PTYPE_CHAR, textual macro PTYPE_SHORT, textual macro Pvartype(), primitive PTYPE_INT, textual macro PTYPE_CARRAY, textual macro PTYPE_CPTR, textual macro PTYPE_POINTER, textual macroint vartype(int i)≤≤#define TYPE_CHAR       1≤#define TYPE_SHORT      2≤#define TYPE_INT        3≤#define TYPE_CARRAY     4       /* character array */≤#define TYPE_CPTR       5       /* character pointer */≤#define TYPE_POINTER    6       /* contains pointers or spots */≤#define TYPE_OTHER      7       /* none of the above */≤æ≤
The vartype( )
primitive
returns information on the type of a global
variable (or buffer-specific or window-specific variable).  It takes
the index of the variable in the name table and returns one of the
above codes if the variable has type character, short, integer,
character array, or character pointer.  It returns
TYPE_POINTER if the variable is a spot or pointer, or a
structure or union containing a spot or pointer.  Otherwise, it
returns TYPE_OTHERMTYPE_OTHER PTYPE_OTHER, textual macro.

Ωnew_variable()MNT_VARMNT_BUFVARMNT_WINVARMNT_COLSCHEMEMTYPE_CHARMTYPE_SHORTMTYPE_INTMTYPE_CARRAY Pnew_variable(), primitive PNT_VAR, textual macro PNT_BUFVAR, textual macro PNT_WINVAR, textual macro PNT_COLSCHEME, textual macro PTYPE_CHAR, textual macro PTYPE_SHORT, textual macro PTYPE_INT, textual macro PTYPE_CARRAY, textual macro PTYPE_CARRAY, textual macroint new_variable(char *name, int type, int vtype, ?int length)≤æ≤
The new_variable( ) primitive provides a way to create a new
variable without having to load a bytecode file.  The first argument
specifies the name of the variable.  The second argument is a type
code of the kind returned by the name_type( ) primitive.  The
code must be NT_VAR for a normal variable, NT_BUFVAR
for a buffer-specific variable, NT_WINVAR for a
window-specific variable, or NT_COLSCHEME for a color scheme.
The third argument is a type code of the kind returned by the
vartype( ) primitive.  This code must be one of the following:
TYPE_CHAR, TYPE_SHORT, TYPE_INT, or
TYPE_CARRAY.  The last argument is a size, which is used only
for TYPE_CARRAY.  It returns the name table index of the new
variable, or -1 if it couldn't create the variable in question.

3Buffer-specific Variables

buffer-specific variablesRusedefaultRusedefltRbufspecvarΩchar use_default;≤æ≤
Epsilon's
buffer-specific variables have a value for each buffer.  They change
when the current buffer changes.  When you create a new buffer, you
also automatically create a new copy of each buffer-specific
variable.  The initial value of each newly created buffer-specific
variable is set from special default values Epsilon maintains.  These
values may be set using the variable use_default≈use_default.
When use_default≈use_default is nonzero,
referencing any buffer-specific variable accesses
its default value, not the value for the current buffer.  Otherwise,
a value particular to the current buffer applies, as usual.

The normal way to reference a variable's default value is to use
the ".default" syntax described in Rdotdefπdotdef, not to
set use_default.

Window-specific variables have a separate value for each window.
When you split a window, the newly created window initially has the
same values for all variables as the original window.  Each
window-specific variable also has a default value, which can be
referred to in the same way as buffer-specific variables, via the
".default" syntax described in Rdotdefπdotdef or by setting
the use_default variable.  Epsilon uses the default value to
initialize the first window it creates, during startup, and when it
creates pop-up windows.

Only the default values of window- and buffer-specific variables are
saved in a state file.

Ωcopy_buffer_variables()safe_copy_buffer_variables() Pcopy_buffer_variables(), primitive Psafe_copy_buffer_variables(), subroutinecopy_buffer_variables(int tobuf, int frombuf)≤safe_copy_buffer_variables(int tobuf, int frombuf)≤æ≤
The copy_buffer_variables( ) primitive sets all
buffer-specific variables in the buffer tobuf to their values in
the buffer frombuf.  If frombuf is zero, Epsilon resets all
buffer-specific variables in the buffer tobuf to their default
values.  The safe_copy_buffer_variables( ) subroutine calls
copy_buffer_variables( ), then clears the values of certain
variables that should not be copied between buffers; generally these
variables are spot variables that must always refer to positions
within their own buffers.

3Bytecode Files

 Pload_from_path(), subroutine Pload_commands(), primitiveload_from_path()load_commands()Ωload_commands(char *file)≤load_from_path(char *file)    /* control.e */≤æ≤
The load_commands( ) primitive loads a bytecode file of
command, subroutine and variable definitions into Epsilon after the
EEL compiler has produced it from the .e source file.  The primitive
changes the name provided so that it has the appropriate .b
extension, then opens and reads the file.  The primitive prints a
message and aborts to top-level if it cannot find the file or the
file name is invalid.

The subroutine load_from_path( ) searches for a bytecode
file using the lookpath( ) primitive (see Rlookpathπlookpath) and loads it using load_commands( ).

Ωeel_compile() Peel_compile(), primitiveint eel_compile(char *file, int use_fsys, char *flags,≤                char *errors, int just_check)≤æ≤
The eel_compile( ) primitive lets Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT
run the EEL compiler via a DLL, without having to invoke a command
processor.  File specifies the name of a file or buffer.  If
use_fsys is nonzero, it names a file; if use_fsys is zero, a
buffer.  The flags parameter may contain any desired command line
flags.  Compiler messages will go to the buffer named errors.
Unless errors occur or the just_check parameter is nonzero,
Epsilon will automatically load the result of the compilation.  No
bytecode file on disk will be modified.  Note that when the compiler
includes header files, it will always read them from disk, even if
they happen to be in an Epsilon buffer.

ΩRwhenloadingwhen_loading()hook, when loading bytecode
filesstrings in when_loading() ftns Pwhen_loading(), subroutinewhen_loading()          /* EEL subroutine */≤æ≤
Any subroutines with the special
name when_loading( ) execute as they are read, and then go
away.  There may be more than one of these functions defined in a
single file.  (Note: When the last function defined in an EEL file
has been deleted or replaced, Epsilon discards all the constant
strings defined in that file.  So a file that contains only a
when_loading( ) function will lose its constant strings as soon
as it exits.  If a pointer to such a string must be put in a global
variable, use the strsave( )≈strsave() primitive to make a copy of it.
See Rstrsaveπstrsave.)

The autoload_commands( )≈autoload_commands() primitive described below executes any
when_loading( ) functions defined in the file, just as
load_commands( ) would.  Epsilon never arranges for a
when_loading( ) function to be autoloaded, and will execute and
discard such functions as soon as they're loaded.  If you run
autoload_commands( )≈autoload_commands() on a file with when_loading( )
functions, Epsilon will execute them twice: once when it initially
sets up the autoloading, and once when it autoloads the file.

Ωuser char *byte_extension;≤user char *state_extension;≤æ≤
The extensions used for Epsilon's bytecode files and state files may
vary with the operating system.  Currently, all operating system
versions of Epsilon use ".b" for bytecode files, and ".sta" for
state files.  The byte_extension≈byte_extension and state_extension≈state_extension
primitives hold the appropriate extension names for the particular
version of Epsilon.

Ωautoload()MNT_AUTOLOADMNT_AUTOSUBR Pautoload(), primitive PNT_AUTOLOAD, textual macro PNT_AUTOSUBR, textual macroautoload(char *name, char *file, int issubr)≤autoload_commands(char *file)≤æ≤
Epsilon has a facility to define functions that are not loaded into
memory until they are invoked.  The autoload( ) primitive takes
the name of a function to define, and the name of a bytecode file it
can be found in.  The file name string may be in a temporary area,
because Epsilon makes a copy of it.

The primitive's final parameter should be nonzero to indicate that
the autoloaded function will be a subroutine, or zero if the function
will be a command.  (Recall that commands are designed to be invoked
directly by the user, and may not take parameters, while subroutines
are generally invoked by commands or other subroutines, and may take
parameters.)  Epsilon enters the command or subroutine in its name
table with a special code to indicate that the function is an
autoloaded function: NT_AUTOLOAD for commands, or
NT_AUTOSUBR for subroutines.

 Pload_from_path(), subroutineWhen Epsilon wants to call an autoloaded function, it first invokes
the EEL subroutine load_from_path( ), passing it the file name
from the autoload( ) call.  The standard definition of this
function is in the file control.e.  It searches for the file along
the EPSPATH, as described in the manual, and then loads the file.
The load_from_path( ) subroutine reports an error and aborts the
calling function if it cannot find the file.

When load_from_path( ) returns, Epsilon checks to see if the
function is now defined as a regular, non-autoloaded function.  If it
is, Epsilon calls it.  However, it is not necessarily an error if the
function is still undefined.  Sometimes a function's work can be done
entirely by the when_loading( ) subroutines that are run and
immediately discarded as a bytecode file loads.

For example, all the work of the set-color command is done by
a when_loading( ) function in the EEL file color.e.  Loading the
corresponding bytecode file automatically runs this
when_loading( ) function, which displays some windows and lets
the user choose colors.  When the user exits from the command,
Epsilon discards the code for the when_loading( ) function that
displayed windows and interpreted keys, and finishes loading the
bytecode file.  The set-color command is still defined as a
command that autoloads the color.b bytecode file, so the next time the
user runs this command, Epsilon will load the file again.

If the autoloaded function was called with parameters, but remains
undefined after Epsilon tries to autoload it, Epsilon aborts the
calling function with an error message.  Functions that use the above
technique to load temporarily may not take parameters.

autoload_commands() Pautoload_commands(), primitiveLike load_commands( ), the primitive autoload_commands( )
takes the name of a compiled EEL bytecode file as a parameter.  It
loads any variables or bindings contained in the file, just like
load_commands( ).  But instead of loading the functions in the
file, this primitive generates an autoload request for each function
in the file.  Whenever any EEL function tries to call a function in
the file, Epsilon will load the entire file.

3Starting and Finishing

 Psave_state(), primitive Pdo_save_state(), subroutinesave_state()do_save_state()Ωdo_save_state(char *file)≤int save_state(char *file)≤æ≤
The do_save_state( ) subroutine writes the current state to the
specified file.  It aborts with an error message if it encounters a
problem.  It uses the save_state( ) primitive to actually write
the state.  The primitive returns 0 if the information was
written successfully, or an error code if there was a problem (as
with file_write( )≈file_write()).  Both change the extension to ".sta"
before using the supplied name.

The state includes all commands, subroutines, keyboard macros, and
variables.  It does not include buffers or windows.  Since a state
file can only be read while Epsilon is starting (when there are no
buffers or windows), only the default value of each buffer-specific
or window-specific variable is saved in a state file.

Pointer variables will have a value of zero when the state file is
loaded again.  Epsilon does not save the object that is pointed to.
Spot variables and structures or unions containing pointers or spots
are also zeroed, but other types of variables are retrieved unchanged
(but see the description of the zeroed keyword in Rzeroedπzeroed).

ΩEPSILON, configuration variableshort argc;≤char *argv[ ];≤æ≤
When Epsilon starts, it examines the arguments on its command line,
and modifies its behavior if it recognizes certain special flags.
(Before examining its command line, it types in the contents of the
configuration variable EPSILON if this exists.)
First it breaks the text of the command line up into individual
words, separated by spaces.  (Words enclosed in " characters may
contain spaces.)  It looks for certain special flags, interprets them
and removes them from the command line.  It then passes the remainder
of the command line to the EEL startup code in cmdline.e.  That code
interprets any remaining flags and files on the command line.  You
can add new flags to Epsilon by modifying cmdline.e.  See Rcomlineπcomline for the meaning of each of Epsilon's flags.

Epsilon interprets and removes these flags from the command line:

Ω– 2 8 36 42 -kKeyboard options-mMemory control-sLoad from state file-eEMS memory control (DOS)-bLoad from bytecode file-xXMS memory control (DOS)-vVideo options-wDirectory options—æ

Some of these settings are visible to an EEL program through
variables.  See the kbd-extended variable for the -ke
flag, the load-from-state variable for the -b flag, the
state_file variable for the -s flag, the want-cols
and want-lines variables for the -vc and -vl flags,
and the directory-flags variable for the -w flag.

argv Pargv, primitiveAll other flags, as well as any specified files, are interpreted by
the EEL functions in cmdline.e.  They read the command line from the
argc≈argc and argv variables, already broken down into
words.  The argc≈argc variable contains the number of words in the
command line.  The argv≈argv variable contains the words
themselves.  The first word on the command line, argv[0], is
always the name of Epsilon's executable file, so that if argc is
2, there was one argument and it is in argv[1].

ΩRstartuphookwhen_restoring()early_init()middle_init()hook, when starting Epsilon Pwhen_restoring(), subroutine Pearly_init(), subroutine Pmiddle_init(), subroutinewhen_restoring()        /* cmdline.e */≤early_init()            /* cmdline.e */≤middle_init()           /* cmdline.e */≤start_up()              /* cmdline.e */≤user char *version;≤apply_defaults()≤æ≤
Epsilon calls
the EEL subroutine when_restoring( ) if it exists after
loading a state file.  Unlike when_loading( ), this subroutine
is not removed after it executes.  The standard version of
when_restoring( ) sets up variables and modes, and interprets
the command line.  It calls several EEL subroutines at various points
in the process.  Each does nothing by default, but you can
conveniently customize Epsilon by redefining them.  (See Rmultipleπmultiple to make sure your extension doesn't interfere with
other extensions.)

start_up() Pstart_up(), subroutine F-l, command line flag F-r, command line flagThe when_restoring( ) function calls early_init( ) just
before interpreting flags, and middle_init( ) just after.
It then loads files (from the command line, or a saved session),
displays Epsilon's version number, and calls the start_up( )
subroutine.  (The version≈version variable contains a string with the
current version of Epsilon, such as "9.0".)  Finally, Epsilon
executes any -l and -r switches.

apply_defaults() Papply_defaults(), primitiveThe when_restoring( ) subroutine calls the
apply_defaults( ) primitive before it calls early_init( ).
This primitive sets the values of window-specific and buffer-specific
variables in the current buffer and window to their default
values.

Ωstate_file Pstate_file, primitivechar state_file[ ];≤user char load_from_state;≤æ≤
The state_file primitive contains the name of the state file
Epsilon was loaded from, or "" if it was loaded only using bytecode
files with the -b flag.  The load_from_state≈load_from_state variable
will be set to 1 if Epsilon loaded its functions from a
state file at startup, or 0 if it loaded only from bytecode files.

Ωafter_loading()Rafterload Pafter_loading(), primitiveafter_loading()≤æ≤
After Epsilon calls the when_restoring( ) subroutine, it finishes
its internal initialization by checking for the existence of certain
variables and functions that must be defined if Epsilon is to run.
Until this is done, Epsilon can't perform a variety of operations
such as getting a key from the keyboard, displaying buffers, and
searching.  The after_loading( ) primitive tells Epsilon to
finish initializing now.  The variables and functions listed in
the table must be defined when you call
after_loading( ).

RneedvarsΩfinish_up() Pfinish_up(), subroutinefinish_up()≤user char leave_blank;≤æ≤
When Epsilon is about to exit, it calls the subroutine
finish_up( ), if it exists.  (See Rmultipleπmultiple to
make sure your extension doesn't interfere with other extensions that
may also define finish_up( ).)  Under DOS and OS/2, it then
tries to restore the screen mode to whatever it was before Epsilon
started (see Rvlswitchπvlswitch).  Then Epsilon normally
redisplays each mode line one last time just before exiting, so any
buffers that it saved just before exiting will not still be marked
unsaved on the screen.  However, if the leave_blank≈leave_blank primitive
is nonzero, it skips this step.  The commands in video.e that handle
screen size switching for DOS and OS/2 make sure this variable is set
just after the screen has been blanked by a screen size change.

3EEL Debugging and Profiling

 Pset_name_debug(), primitive Pname_debug(), primitiveset_name_debug()name_debug()Ωint name_debug(int index)≤set_name_debug(int index, int flag)≤æ≤
Every command or subroutine in Epsilon's name table has an associated
debug flag.  If the debug flag of a command or subroutine is nonzero,
Epsilon will start up the EEL debugger when the function is called,
allowing you to step through the function line by line.  See Rdebugπdebug.  The name_debug( ) primitive returns the
debug flag for an item, and the set_name_debug( ) primitive
sets it.

Ωstart_profiling()stop_profiling()get_profile()profiling primitives Pstart_profiling(), primitive Pstop_profiling(), primitive Pget_profile(), primitivestart_profiling()≤stop_profiling()≤char *get_profile()≤æ≤
Epsilon can generate an execution profile
of a section of EEL code.  A profile is a tool to determine which
parts of a program are taking the most time.  The
start_profiling( ) primitive begins storing profiling
information internally.  Profiling continues until Epsilon runs out
of space, or you call the stop_profiling( ) primitive,
which stops storing the information.  Many times each second, Epsilon
saves away information describing the location in the source file of
the EEL code it is executing, if you've turned profiling on.  You can
use this to see where a command is spending its time, so that you can
center your efforts to speed the command up there.

Once you stop the profiling with the stop_profiling( )≈stop_profiling()
primitive, you can retrieve the profiling information with the
get_profile( ) primitive.  Each call returns one line of the
stored profile information, and the function returns a null pointer
when all the information has been retrieved.  Each line contains the
name of an EEL source file and a line number within the file,
separated by a space.  See the profile command for a more
convenient way to use these primitives.  Functions that you've
compiled with the EEL compiler's -s flag will not appear in the
profile.  Epsilon for Windows 3.1 doesn't provide profiling.

3Help Subroutines

 Pget_doc(), subroutine Pname_help(), primitive Pset_name_help(), primitiveget_doc()name_help()set_name_help()ΩRedoc-formatint name_help(int index)≤set_name_help(int index, int offset)≤get_doc()               /* help.e */≤æ≤
Every item in Epsilon's name table has an associated help file
offset.  The help offset contains the position in Epsilon's help file
"edoc" where information on an item is stored.  Epsilon uses it to
provide quick access to help file items.  It is initially -1, and
may be set with the set_name_help( ) primitive and examined
with the name_help( ) primitive.  (The Windows version of
Epsilon normally uses a standard Windows help file to display help,
so it doesn't use these help file offsets.)

When an EEL function wants to look up information in the help file,
it calls the EEL subroutine get_doc( ).  This function loads
the help file into the buffer "-edoc" if it hasn't been loaded
before.

Epsilon's help file "edoc" uses a simple format
that makes it easy to add new entries for your own commands.  Each
command's description begins with a line consisting of a tilde
(~), the command or variable's name, a ⁄Tab€, and the
command's one-line description (or, for a variable, some type
information).  Following lines (until the next line that starts with
~, or the end of the file) constitute the command's full
description.  The entries can occur in any order; they don't have to
be listed alphabetically.

 Pview_linked_buf(), subroutineAn entry can contain a cross-reference link to another entry in the
file; these consist of the name of the command or variable being
cross-referenced, bracketed by two control characters.  Put a ^A
character before the name of the command or variable, and a ^B
character after.  Also see the description of the
view_linked_buf( ) subroutine in Rviewlinkedπview-linked.

Ωhelp_on_command()help_on_current() Phelp_on_command(), subroutine Phelp_on_current(), subroutinehelp_on_command(int ind)             /* help.e */≤help_on_current()       /* help.e */≤æ≤
The help_on_command( ) subroutine provides help on a particular
command.  It takes the name table index of the command to provide
help on.

The help_on_current( ) subroutine displays help on the
currently-running command.  It uses the last_index≈last_index variable to
determine the current command.

Ωshow_binding() Pshow_binding(), subroutineshow_binding(char *fmt, char *cmd)  /* help.e */≤æ≤
The show_binding( ) subroutine displays the message fmt
using the say( ) primitive.  The fmt must contain the
%s sequence (and no other % sequences).
Epsilon will replace the %s with the binding of the
command cmd.  For example,

Ωshow_binding("Type ≥s to continue", "exit-level");≤æ≤
displays "Type Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z to continue" with Epsilon's
normal bindings.

2Input Primitives
3Keys

 Pwait_for_key(), primitive PNUMKEYS, textual macrowait_for_key()RgetkeyΩwait_for_key()≤user short key;≤when_idle(int times)     /* EEL subroutine */≤when_repeating()         /* EEL subroutine */≤int is_key_repeating()≤æ≤

The wait_for_key( ) primitive advances to the next key, waiting
for one if necessary.  The variable key≈key stores the last key
obtained from wait_for_key( ).  Its value may be from 0 to
NUMKEYS - 1.  The macro πMNUMKEYS is defined in eel.h.

When you call wait_for_key( )≈wait_for_key(), it first checks to see if the
ungot_key≈ungot_key variable has a key (see below) and uses that if it
does.  If not, and a keyboard macro is active, wait_for_key( )≈wait_for_key()
returns the next character from the macro.  (The primitive also keeps
track of repeat counts for macros.)  If there is no key in
ungot_key≈ungot_key and no macro is active, the primitive checks to see
if you have already typed another key and returns it if you have.  If
not, the primitive waits until you type a key (or a mouse action or
other event occurs--Epsilon treats all of these as keys).

In the DOS version, if there is a concurrent process running, the
primitive dispatches to the process to let it run until you press a
key, instead of waiting.  Even in other environments where a
concurrent process can run independently of Epsilon, the process's
output is only inserted in an Epsilon buffer during a call to
wait_for_key( ).  Epsilon handles the processing of other
concurrent events like FTP transfers during this time as well.

when_idle() Pwhen_idle(), subroutineWhile Epsilon is waiting for a key, it calls the
when_idle( ) subroutine.  The default version of this
function does idle-time code coloring and displays any defined
idle-time message in the echo area (see Rshowwhenidleπshow-when-idle).  The when_idle( ) subroutine receives
a parameter that indicates the number of times the subroutine has
been called since Epsilon began waiting for a key.  Every time
Epsilon gets a key (or other event), it resets this count to zero.

The when_idle( ) subroutine should return a timeout code in
hundredths of a second.  Epsilon will not call the subroutine again
until the specified time has elapsed, or another key arrives.  If it
doesn't need Epsilon to call it for one second, for example, it can
return 100.  If it wants Epsilon to call it again as soon as
possible (assuming Epsilon remains idle), it can return 0.  If
the subroutine has completed all its work and doesn't need to be
called again until after the next keystroke or mouse event, it can
return -1.  Epsilon will then go idle waiting for the next event.
(The return value is only advisory; Epsilon may call
when_idle( ) more frequently or less frequently than it
requests.)

when_repeating() Pwhen_repeating(), subroutineWhen you hold down a key to make it repeat, Epsilon does not call the
when_idle( ) subroutine.  Instead, it calls the
when_repeating( ) subroutine.  Again, this varies by
environment: under some operating systems, Epsilon cannot distinguish
between repeated key presses and holding down a key to make it
repeat.  If this is the case, Epsilon won't call the function.

is_key_repeating()repeating, keys Pis_key_repeating(), primitiveThe is_key_repeating( ) primitive
returns nonzero if the user is currently holding down a key causing
it to repeat.  Epsilon can't detect this in all environments, so the
primitive always returns 0 in that case.

Ωgetkey()_len_def_mac Pgetkey(), subroutine V_len_def_mac, variableint getkey()            /* control.e */≤æ≤
Instead of calling wait_for_key( )≈wait_for_key() directly, EEL commands
should call the EEL subroutine getkey( ) (defined in
control.e), to allow certain actions that are written in EEL code to
take effect on each character.  For example, the standard version of
getkey( ) saves each new character in a macro, if you're
defining one.  It checks the EEL variable _len_def_mac,
which contains the length of the macro being defined plus one, or
zero if you're not defining a macro.  For convenience, getkey( )
also returns the new key.  The getkey( ) subroutine calls
wait_for_key( )≈wait_for_key().  (If you want to add functions to
getkey( ), see Rmultipleπmultiple to make sure your
extension doesn't interfere with other extensions that may also add
to getkey( ).)

Ωchar_avail()in_macro()Reelkeys Pchar_avail(), primitive Pin_macro(), primitiveint char_avail()≤int in_macro()≤æ≤
The char_avail( ) primitive returns 0 if wait_for_key( )≈wait_for_key()
would have to wait if it were called, and 1 otherwise.  That is, it
returns nonzero if and only if a key is available from
ungot_key, a keyboard macro, or the keyboard.

The in_macro( ) primitive returns 1 if a keyboard macro is
running or has been suspended, 0 otherwise.  While processing the
last key of a keyboard macro, in_macro( ) will return 0,
because Epsilon has already discarded the keyboard macro by that
time.  Check the ¬key-from-macro≈key-from-macro variable instead to see if the
key currently being handled came from a macro.

MALT()MCTRL() PALT(), textual macro PCTRL(), textual macroThere are some textual macros defined in eel.h which help in forming the
codes for keys in an EEL function.  The codes for normal ASCII keys
are their ASCII codes, so the code for the key "a" is 'a'.  The
ALT() macro makes these normal keys into
their Alt forms, so the code for Alt-a is ALT('a').  The
CTRL() macro changes a character into
the corresponding control character, so CTRL('h') or
CTRL('H') both represent the Ctrl-h key.  Both CTRL(ALT('q'))
and ALT(CTRL('q')) stand for the Ctrl-A-q key.

The remaining key codes represent the non-ASCII keys, plus various
key codes that represent other kinds of input events, such as mouse
activity.

MFKEY() PFKEY(), textual macroThe FKEY() macro represents the function keys.  FKEY(1)
and FKEY(12) are F1 and F12, respectively.  Note that this
macro takes a number, not a character.

KEYEND, KEYDOWN, KEYPGDN,
KEYLEFT, KEYRIGHT, KEYHOME,
KEYUP, KEYPGUP, and KEYDELETE.  If you
use the -ke switch to separate the numeric keypad from the
cursor pad, you can refer to the numeric keypad keys with the
NUMDIGIT() macro: NUMDIGIT(0) is N-0, and
NUMDIGIT(9) is N-9.  NUMDOT is the numeric keypad
period, and NUMENTER is the ⁄Enter€ or ⁄Return€ key
on the numeric keypad (normally mapped to Ctrl-M).

GREYMINUS, GREYSTAR and GREYSLASH for
the +, -, *, and / keys on the numeric keypad, and
GREYENTER, GREYBACK, GREYTAB, and
GREYESC for the ⁄Enter€, ⁄Backspace€, ⁄Tab€,
and ⁄Esc€ keys, respectively.  (By default, several of these keys
are mapped to others.  See below.)

NUMSHIFT(), NUMCTRL(), and NUMALT()
macros make shifted, control, and alt versions, respectively.  For
example, NUMCTRL(NUMDIGIT(3)) is Ctrl-N-<PgDn>, and
NUMALT(KEYDELETE) is A-<Del>.

Ωmake_alt()make_ctrl()MIS_CTRL_KEY()MIS_ALT_KEY() Pmake_alt(), subroutine Pmake_ctrl(), subroutine PIS_CTRL_KEY(), textual macro PIS_ALT_KEY(), textual macroint make_alt(int k)          /* control.e */≤int make_ctrl(int k)         /* control.e */≤æ≤
The macros such as πMALT( ) and πMNUMALT( )
described above create the codes for Alt versions of various types of
keys.  The make_alt( ) subroutine defined in control.e will
return an Alt version of any key.  Use one of the macros when the key
involved is constant, and use the subroutine when it's variable.  The
make_ctrl( ) subroutine is similar, but makes a key into its
Control version.

Use the IS_CTRL_KEY() macro to determine if a given key is a
control key of some kind.  Its value is nonzero if the key is an
ASCII Control character, a function key with Control held down, or
any other Control key.  It understands all types of keys.  The macro
IS_ALT_KEY() is similar; its value is nonzero if the given key
was generated when holding down the Alt key.

 PEXTEND_SEL_KEY, textual macroKeys returned from a macro can use some special bit flags.  Epsilon
uses the πMEXTEND_SEL_KEY bit flag to indicate that the shift
key was held down when the current key in the macro was recorded,
indicating that text should be selected.  See Rshiftselectsπshift-selects for details.

MCMD_INDEX_KEY PCMD_INDEX_KEY, textual macroA macro command recorded using the notation
<!find-file> uses the bit flag
CMD_INDEX_KEY.  In this case the value of key is not a
true key, but rather the name table index of the specified command.
See Rkeynamesπkeynames for more information.

If the ungot_key≈ungot_key variable is set to some value other than its
usual value of -1, that number is placed in key as the new
key when wait_for_key( ) is called next, and ungot_key is
set to -1 again.  You can use this to make a command that reads
keys itself, then exits and runs the key again when you press an
unrecognized key.  The statement ungot_key = key; accomplishes
this.

Ωshow_char() Pshow_char(), primitiveshow_char(char *str, int key, ?int style)≤æ≤
The show_char( ) primitive converts a key code to its printed
representation, described in Rkeynamesπkeynames.  For example,
the code produced by function key 3 generates the string F-3.
The string is ªappendedº to the character array str.

If show_char( )'s optional third parameter is present, and
nonzero, this primitive will use a longer, more readable printed
representation.  For example, rather than C-A-S or , or
S-F-10, show_char( ) will return Ctrl-Alt-S or
<Comma> or Shift-F10.  (Epsilon can only parse the former
style, in Epsilon command files and in all other commands that use
the get_keycode( ) primitive below.)

Ωget_keycode()stuff_macro() Pget_keycode(), primitive Pstuff_macro(), subroutineshort *get_keycode()≤stuff_macro(short *mac, int oneline)≤æ≤
The get_keycode( ) primitive is used to translate a sequence of
key names such as "C-xC-A-f" into the equivalent key codes.  It
moves past a quoted sequence of key names in the buffer and returns
an array of short ints with the key codes.  The same array is used
each time the function is called.  The first entry of the array
contains the number of array entries.  The primitive returns null if
the string had an invalid key name.

The stuff_macro( ) subroutine inserts a sequence of key
names into the current buffer in a format that get_keycode( ) can
read, surrounding the key names with " characters.  The list of
keys is specified by an array of short ints in the same format
get_keycode( ) uses: the first value contains the total number of
array entries.  If oneline is nonzero, the subroutine represents
line breaks with ¥n so that the text stays on one line.

ΩRkeytrankeytranMKEYTRANPASS Pkeytran, primitive PKEYTRANPASS, textual macroshort *keytran;≤#define KEYTRANPASS     1000≤æ≤

The keytran primitive is a pointer to a short.  It must point
to an array of πMNUMKEYS shorts.  This array changes the mapping
of the keyboard, by changing the code the keyboard gives for a
particular key.  This change happens only when wait_for_key( )≈wait_for_key()
returns a key from the keyboard, not when it returns a key from a
keyboard macro.  The value inserted in key≈key is actually
keytran[»original-key-code…].

If the value in keytran is -1, the original key code is used
anyway.  (Most keys use this setting.)  If the value is -2, the
key is silently ignored.  If the value in keytran is
KEYTRANPASS or more, Epsilon subtracts
KEYTRANPASS before using the new value (but see below).

In the DOS version, some keytran values have a special meaning.
Epsilon needs to use some keys that the BIOS normally considers
invalid and discards.  To prevent this, Epsilon intercepts all keys
before the BIOS gets them, and decides whether to let the BIOS see
them or not.  (Epsilon could keep all the keys and never let the BIOS
see them, but then any resident software or TSR's you had wouldn't be
able to see them either.)

Epsilon decides whether to let the BIOS see each key based on its
keytran entry.  If it's a valid key code, Epsilon keeps it from
the BIOS.  If it's -2, Epsilon ignores it.  Otherwise, (if it's
-1, or KEYTRANPASS or more), Epsilon sends it to the BIOS.
When it comes back, if its entry was KEYTRANPASS or more,
Epsilon subtracts KEYTRANPASS from the entry and uses that
number as the key.

This scheme means that any given key can be either ignored, sent to
the BIOS, kept by Epsilon, kept but translated to another key, or
sent to the BIOS and then (if the BIOS sends it back) translated to
another key.  These correspond to keytran entries of -2, -1,
ªkº, ªnº, and KEYTRANPASSª + nº, respectively, where ªkº is the
original key, and ªnº is the other key it could be replaced by.

By default, Epsilon keeps all keys that the BIOS considers invalid
and would discard, and passes the rest through to the BIOS.  The keys
that Epsilon keeps are invisible to any resident programs that
intercept keys, and cannot be used as "hot keys".  Epsilon's
¬program-keys command, described in Rprogkeysπprog-keys,
is useful for altering the keytran array.

Ωuser char key_type;≤user short key_code;≤user char kbd_extended;≤æ≤
When wait_for_key( ) returns a key that comes directly from the
keyboard, it also sets the primitive variables key_type≈key_type and
key_code≈key_code.  These let EEL programs distinguish between keys
that translate to the same Epsilon key code, for certain special
applications.  The wait_for_key( ) primitive doesn't change
either variable when the key comes from ungot_key.

The key_code variable contains the sixteen-bit BIOS encoding for
the key that Epsilon received from the operating system.  Its ASCII
code is in the low eight bits and its scan code is in the high eight
bits.  Under DOS, the key_code is zero when the keytran
table entry for a key instructs Epsilon not to pass the key to the
BIOS.

MKT_KEYTRANMKT_NONASCIIMKT_NONASCII_EXT PKT_KEYTRAN, textual macro PKT_NONASCII, textual macro PKT_NONASCII_EXT, textual macroThe key_type variable has one of the following values, defined
in codes.h.  If KT_KEYTRAN, the key had an explicit
translation in the keytran table and Epsilon used it without
passing it to the BIOS.  If KT_NONASCII or
KT_NONASCII_EXT, the key was a special key without an ASCII
translation, such as a function key.  Such keys are of type
KT_NONASCII_EXT if they're one of the "E0" keys on an
extended keyboard that are synonyms to multikey sequences on the old
keyboard, such as the keys on the extended keyboard's cursor pad.
Under DOS, these keys are of type KT_NONASCII_EXT only if you
use the -ke switch, otherwise they're of type KT_NONASCII.

MKT_ACCENT_SEQMKT_ACCENTMKT_NORMAL PKT_ACCENT_SEQ, textual macro PKT_ACCENT, textual macro PKT_NORMAL, textual macroA key type of KT_ACCENT_SEQ indicates a multikey sequence
that the operating system or a resident program has translated as a
single key, such as an Í.  Key type KT_ACCENT generally
means the operating system translated a single key to a graphics
character or foreign language character.  Key type
KT_NORMAL represents any other key.  Most keys have a key
type of KT_NORMAL.

MKT_MACROMKT_EXTEND_SEL PKT_MACRO, textual macro PEXTEND_SEL_KEY, textual macro PKT_EXTEND_SEL, textual macroA key type of KT_MACRO means the key came from a macro.
But a macro key recorded with the πMEXTEND_SEL_KEY bit flag
returns a key type of KT_EXTEND_SEL instead.  In either
case, the key_code variable is set to zero in this case.

In Epsilon for Windows or Unix, the key_code variable is always
zero, and key_type is either KT_NORMAL, KT_MACRO, or
KT_EXTEND_SEL.

 F-ke, command line flagThe kbd_extended≈kbd_extended variable tells whether the -ke flag was
used to make the numeric pad and cursor pad keys distinct.  Normally,
both are treated the same, and this variable is zero.  If you give
the -ke flag, Epsilon treats these as separate sets of keys, and
makes the variable nonzero.

3The Mouse

Rcatch-mouseWhen a mouse event occurs, such as a button press or a mouse
movement, Epsilon enqueues the information in the same data structure
it uses for keyboard events.  A call to wait_for_key( ) retrieves
the next item from the queue--either a keystroke or a mouse event.
Normally an EEL program calls the getkey( ) subroutine instead
of wait_for_key( ).  See Rgetkeyπgetkey.

Ωuser short catch_mouse;≤æ≤
The catch_mouse≈catch_mouse primitive controls whether
Epsilon will queue up any mouse events.  Setting it to zero causes
Epsilon to ignore the mouse.  A nonzero value makes Epsilon queue up
mouse events.  If your system has no mouse, setting catch_mouse
has no effect.  Under DOS, various values of catch_mouse
correspond to settings of the -km, -kc and -kw
switches:

Ω– c0 10 30 ValueEquivalent FlagsNotes0-km0Mouse unavailable/ignored.1-km2 -kc1 or 2Default (-kc2 on EGA/VGA, -kc1 otherwise).2-km2 -kc0Relative positioning, invisible cursor.3-km1 -kc1 or 2Absolute positioning, normal cursor.4-km1 -kc0For windowed environment, equivalent to -kw.—æ

¿Catch-mouse values, and the equivalent command-line flags¡

If you run Epsilon for DOS under Microsoft Windows full-screen, be
sure to set catch-mouse to 4 before you press Alt-Enter to
switch to a window.  You can set catch-mouse back to 1 when you
return Epsilon to full-screen.  The same comments apply when running
the DOS version under OS/2 PM.

Ωuser short mouse_mask;≤user short mouse_x, mouse_y;≤user short mouse_screen;≤user int double_click_time;≤æ≤
You can control which mouse events Epsilon dequeues, and which it
ignores, by using the mouse_mask≈mouse_mask primitive.  The following
values, defined in codes.h, control this:

Ω#define MASK_MOVE       0x01≤#define MASK_LEFT_DN    0x02≤#define MASK_LEFT_UP    0x04≤#define MASK_RIGHT_DN   0x08≤#define MASK_RIGHT_UP   0x10≤#define MASK_CENTER_DN  0x20≤#define MASK_CENTER_UP  0x40≤#define MASK_ALL        0x7f≤#define MASK_BUTTONS    (MASK_ALL - MASK_MOVE)≤#define MASK_DN         // ... see eel.h≤#define MASK_UP         // ... see eel.h≤æ≤
For example, the following EEL code would cause Epsilon to pay
attention to the left mouse button and mouse movement, but ignore
everything else:

ΩRmousekeysmouse_mask = MASK_MOVE | MASK_LEFT_DN | MASK_LEFT_UP;≤æ≤
When Epsilon dequeues a mouse event with
wait_for_key( ), it sets the values of mouse_x≈mouse_x and
mouse_y≈mouse_y to the screen coordinates associated with that mouse
event.  Setting them moves the mouse cursor.  The upper left corner
has coordinate (0, 0).

When dequeuing a mouse event, wait_for_key( ) returns one of the
following "keys" (defined in codes.h):

ΩRmousescreenMMOUSE_LEFT_DNMMOUSE_DBL_LEFT PMOUSE_LEFT_DN, textual macro PMOUSE_DBL_LEFT, textual macroMOUSE_LEFT_DN     MOUSE_LEFT_UP     MOUSE_DBL_LEFT      MOUSE_MOVE≤MOUSE_CENTER_DN   MOUSE_CENTER_UP   MOUSE_DBL_CENTER≤MOUSE_RIGHT_DN    MOUSE_RIGHT_UP    MOUSE_DBL_RIGHT≤æ≤
Dequeuing a mouse event also sets the
mouse_screen≈mouse_screen variable to indicate which screen its coordinates
refer to.  Screen coordinates are relative to the specified screen.
Ordinary Epsilon windows are on the main screen, screen 0.  When
Epsilon creates a dialog box containing Epsilon windows, each Epsilon
window receives its own screen number.  For example, if you type
Ctrl-X Ctrl-F ?, Epsilon displays a dialog box with two screens,
usually numbered 1 and 2.  If you click on the ninth line of
the second screen, Epsilon returns the key MOUSE_LEFT_DN, sets
mouse_y to 8 (counting from zero), and sets mouse_screen to 2.

The double_click_time≈double_click_time primitive specifies how long a delay to
allow for double-clicks (in hundredths of a second).  If two
consecutive MOUSE_LEFT_DN events occur within the allotted
time, then Epsilon enqueues a MOUSE_DBL_LEFT event in place
of the second MOUSE_LEFT_DN event.  The corresponding thing
happens for right clicks and center clicks as well.  Epsilon for
Windows ignores this variable and uses standard Windows settings to
determine double-clicks.

The IS_MOUSE_KEY() macro returns a nonzero value if the
given key code indicates a mouse event.  The IS_TRUE_KEY()
macro returns a nonzero value if the given key code indicates a
keyboard key.  The IS_EXT_ASCII_KEY() macro returns a
nonzero value if the given key code represents a character that can
appear in a buffer (rather than a function key or cursor key).  The
IS_WIN_KEY() macro returns a nonzero value if the given key
code indicates a window event like a menu selection, pressing a
button on a dialog, or getting the focus.

IS_MOUSE_DOUBLE() macros return nonzero if the given key
code represents a single-click or double-click, respectively, of any
mouse button.  The IS_MOUSE_DOWN() macro returns nonzero if
the key code represents the pressing of any mouse button (either a
single-click or a double-click).  Finally, the
IS_MOUSE_UP() macro tells if a particular key code
represents the release of any mouse button.

Ωy_pixels_per_char()x_pixels_per_char() Py_pixels_per_char(), primitive Px_pixels_per_char(), primitiveuser short mouse_pixel_x, mouse_pixel_y;≤int y_pixels_per_char()≤int x_pixels_per_char()≤clip_mouse()  /* mouse.e subr. */≤æ≤
On most systems, Epsilon can provide the mouse position with finer
resolution than simply which character it is on.  The
mouse_pixel_x≈mouse_pixel_x and mouse_pixel_y≈mouse_pixel_y variables contain the
mouse position in the most accurate form Epsilon provides.  Setting
the pixel variables moves the mouse cursor and resets the
mouse_x and mouse_y variables to match.  Similarly, setting
mouse_x or mouse_y resets the corresponding pixel variable.

EEL subroutines should not assume any particular scaling between the
screen character coordinates provided by mouse_x and
mouse_y and these "pixel" variables.  The scaling varies with
the screen display mode or selected font.  As with the character
coordinates, the upper left corner has pixel coordinate (0, 0).  The
y_pixels_per_char( ) and x_pixels_per_char( )
primitives report the current scaling between pixels and characters.
For example, mouse_x usually equals the quantity
mouse_pixel_x / x_pixels_per_char(), rounded down to an integer.

The mouse_x variable can range from -1 to screen_cols,
while the valid screen columns range from 0 to (screen_cols -
1).  Epsilon uses the additional values to indicate that the user
has tried to move the mouse cursor off the screen, in environments
which can detect this.  (Only Epsilon for DOS or Epsilon for OS/2 can
detect this, and only when running full-screen.)  The
mouse_pixel_x variable, on the other hand, ranges from 0 to
screen_cols * x_pixels_per_char().  The highest and lowest values
of mouse_pixel_x correspond to the highest and lowest values of
mouse_x, while other values obey the relation outlined in the
previous paragraph.  The mouse_y and mouse_pixel_y
variables work in the same way.

clip_mouse() Pclip_mouse(), subroutineThe clip_mouse( ) subroutine alters the mouse_x and
mouse_y variables so that they refer to a valid screen column,
if they currently range off the screen.

When Epsilon dequeues a mouse event with wait_for_key( ), it also
sets the mouse_shift≈mouse_shift variable to indicate which shift keys
were depressed at the time the mouse event was enqueued.  The
shift_pressed( ) primitive returns the same codes, but
indicates which shift keys are depressed at the moment you call it.

The was_key_shifted( ) subroutine tells if the user held down Shift
when pressing the current key.  Some keys produce the same key code with or
without shift.

Unlike the shift_pressed( ) primitive, which reports on the current state
of the Shift key, this one works with keyboard macros by returning the state
of the Shift key at the time the key was originally pressed.  A subroutine
must call was_key_shifted( ) at the time the macro is recorded for the
Shift state to be recorded in the macro.  Macros defined by a command file
can use an E- prefix to indicate this.

Ωmouse_buttons()mouse_pressed()get_movement_or_release() Pmouse_buttons(), primitive Pmouse_pressed(), primitive Pget_movement_or_release(), subroutineshort mouse_buttons()≤int mouse_pressed()≤get_movement_or_release()  /* menu.e */≤æ≤
The mouse_buttons( ) primitive returns the number of buttons on
the mouse.  A value of zero means that Epsilon could not find a mouse
on the system.

The mouse_pressed( ) primitive returns a nonzero value if and
only if some button on the mouse has gone down but has not yet gone
up.  The subroutine get_movement_or_release( ) uses this
function.  It delays until the mouse moves or all its buttons have
been released.

4Mouse Cursors

Ωuser short mouse_display;≤user short mouse_auto_on;    /* default = 1 */≤user short mouse_auto_off;   /* default = 1 */≤æ≤
The mouse_display≈mouse_display primitive controls whether or not Epsilon
displays the mouse cursor.  Set it to zero to turn the mouse cursor
off, and to a nonzero value to turn the mouse cursor on.  Turning off
the mouse cursor does not cause Epsilon to stop queuing up mouse
events--to do that, use catch_mouse.

Epsilon automatically turns on the mouse cursor when it detects mouse
motion, if the mouse_auto_on≈mouse_auto_on primitive has a nonzero value.
Epsilon automatically turns off the mouse when you start to type on
the keyboard, if the mouse_auto_off≈mouse_auto_off primitive has a nonzero
value.  Neither of these actions affect the status of queuing up
mouse events.  When Epsilon automatically turns on the mouse cursor,
it sets mouse_display to 2.

Ωuser short mouse_graphic_cursor;≤typedef struct mouse_cursor {≤        char on_pixels[32];≤        char off_pixels[32];≤        char hot_x, hot_y;≤        short stock_cursor;≤} MOUSE_CURSOR;≤MOUSE_CURSOR *mouse_cursor;≤MOUSE_CURSOR std_pointer;≤user int mouse_cursor_attr;≤user int mouse_cursor_char;≤æ≤
Under DOS, Epsilon supports two types of mouse cursors.  If the
primitive mouse_graphic_cursor≈mouse_graphic_cursor has a nonzero value, Epsilon
uses a graphic arrow symbol.  If mouse_graphic_cursor has a
value of zero, Epsilon uses a reverse-highlighted character cell for
the mouse cursor.

mouse_cursor Pmouse_cursor, primitiveMOUSE_CURSOR, type definitionBy default, this arrow points to the left, but you can specify a
pixel pattern to use by setting the mouse_cursor primitive.
It points to a structure of type MOUSE_CURSOR that defines the
shape of the mouse cursor, and the hot spot.  The
MOUSE_CURSOR type is built into Epsilon.

Epsilon turns off screen pixels according to the off_pixels
member, then toggles screen pixels according to the on_pixels
member.  In other words, if orig contains a bit pattern from the
screen while on and off hold bit patterns from the cursor
structure, the C language expression ((orig & off) ^ on)
represents the bit pattern shown on the screen.  The hot_x and
hot_y members specify the pixel coordinates of the hot spot
within the cursor image.  Epsilon always positions the cursor so that
the hot spot appears at the current mouse pixel coordinates, and
restricts mouse cursor movements so the hot spot is never off the
screen.

std_pointer Pstd_pointer, primitiveThe std_pointer primitive variable contains Epsilon's
standard left-pointing arrow cursor.  Use the syntax mouse_cursor
= &some_cursor; to set the cursor to a different MOUSE_CURSOR
variable.

You can also alter the way Epsilon displays the cursor in text mode.
Epsilon toggles the bits of the color attribute code of the
underlying screen character according to the value of the
mouse_cursor_attr≈mouse_cursor_attr primitive.  The default value of 0x77
alters both foreground and background colors, while 0x7 and
0x70 alter only one or the other.  A value of zero doesn't
change the attribute.

If the mouse_cursor_char≈mouse_cursor_char primitive is nonzero, Epsilon
replaces the character under the cursor with the given value.  For
example, if this variable contains the ASCII code for "*", the mouse
cursor will be a "*" character.  By default, mouse_cursor_char
is zero and mouse_cursor_attr is 0x77.

Epsilon for OS/2 always uses a block cursor in full-screen sessions.
In windowed sessions, OS/2 displays a graphic cursor, but the
mouse_display and mouse_cursor variables have no effect on
it.

Epsilon for Windows uses one of several standard Windows cursors.
The stock_cursor member of the mouse_cursor variable selects
which standard Windows cursor to use, according to the following
table, which lists the stock cursor codes defined in codes.h:

Ω– 2 20 CURSOR_ARROWStandard arrowCURSOR_IBEAMText I-beamCURSOR_WAITHourglassCURSOR_CROSSCrosshairCURSOR_UPARROWArrow pointing upCURSOR_SIZEResizeCURSOR_ICONEmpty iconCURSOR_SIZENWSEDouble-headed arrow pointing northwest and southeastCURSOR_SIZENESWDouble-headed arrow pointing northeast and southwestCURSOR_SIZEWEDouble-headed arrow pointing east and westCURSOR_SIZENSDouble-headed arrow pointing north and southCURSOR_PANNeutral cursor for wheeled mouse panningCURSOR_PAN_UPWheeled mouse cursor when panning upCURSOR_PAN_DOWNWheeled mouse cursor when panning down—æ

The mouse.e and menu.e files define the commands and functions
normally bound to the mouse buttons.  The functions that handle
button clicks examine the window-specific function pointer
mouse_handler so that you can easily provide special functions
for clicks in a particular window.  By default, the variable contains
0 in each window, so that Epsilon does no special processing.  Set
the variable to point to a function, and Epsilon will call it
whenever the user pushes a mouse button and the mouse cursor is over
the indicated window.  The function receives one parameter, the
window handle of the specified window.  It can return nonzero to
prevent the normal functioning of the button, or zero to let the
function proceed.

allow_mouse_switching() Pallow_mouse_switching(), subroutineThe allow_mouse_switching( ) subroutine is a mouse_handler
function.  Normally, when a pop-up window is on the screen, Epsilon
doesn't let the user simply switch to another window.  Depending on
the context, Epsilon either removes the pop-up window and then
switches to the new window, or signals an error and remains in the
pop-up window.  If you set the mouse_handler variable in a
particular window to the allow_mouse_switching( ) subroutine,
Epsilon will permit switching to that window if the user clicks
in it, without deleting any pop-up window.

The buffer-specific ¬mouse_dbl_selects≈mouse_dbl_selects variable controls what
double-clicking with a mouse button does.  By default the variable is
zero, and double-clicking selects words.  If the variable is nonzero,
Epsilon instead runs the command bound to the ⁄Newline€ key.

The ¬run_by_mouse≈run_by_mouse variable is normally zero.  Epsilon sets it
to one while it runs a command that was selected via a pull-down menu
or using the tool bar.  Commands can use this variable to behave
differently in this case.  For example, the subroutine that provides
completion automatically produces a list of choices to choose from,
when run via the mouse.  It does this if the πMMUST_MATCH flag
(see Rfinderflagsπfinderflags) indicates that the user must always
pick one of the choices (instead of typing in a different selection),
or if the ¬show-mouse-choices≈show-mouse-choices variable is nonzero.

4The Scroll Bar

Ωscroll_bar_line() Pscroll_bar_line(), primitiveuser window int display_scroll_bar;≤int scroll_bar_line()≤æ≤
The built-in variable display_scroll_bar≈display_scroll_bar controls whether or
not the current window's right border contains a scroll bar.  Set it
to zero to turn off the scroll bar, or to any positive number to
display the bar.  If a window has no right border, or has room for
fewer than two lines of text, Epsilon won't display a scroll bar.
Although the EEL functions that come with Epsilon don't support
clicking on a scroll bar on the left border of a window, Epsilon will
display one if display_scroll_bar is negative.  Any positive
value produces the usual right-border scroll bar.  (This variable,
and the following primitive, have no effect in Epsilon for Windows,
which handles scrolling internally.)

The scroll_bar_line( ) primitive returns the position of the
scroll box diamond on the scroll bar.  A value of one indicates the
line just below the arrow at the top of the scroll bar.  Epsilon
always positions this arrow adjacent to the first line of text in the
window, so a return value of »n… indicates the scroll box lies
adjacent to text line »n… in the window (numbered from zero).

Ωscroll_by_wheel() Pscroll_by_wheel(), subroutine PWIN_WHEEL_KEY, textual macroscroll_by_wheel(int clicks, int per_click)≤æ≤
When you use a wheeled mouse like the Microsoft IntelliMouse, Epsilon
for Windows 95/98/NT calls the scroll_by_wheel( ) subroutine
whenever you roll its wheel.  (See the next section for information
on what happens when you click the wheel, not roll it.)  Epsilon
provides the number of clicks of the wheel since the last time this
function was called (which may be positive or negative) and the
control panel setting that indicates the number of lines Epsilon
should scroll on each click.

After calling this subroutine, Epsilon can then optionally generate a
πMWIN_WHEEL_KEY key event.  See Rpermitwindowkeysπpermit-window-keys.

4Mouse Panning

IntelliMouse support Pmouse_panning_rate(), primitivemouse_panning_rate()Ωint mouse_panning;≤int mouse_panning_rate(int percent, int slow, int fast)≤æ≤
The mouse_panning≈mouse_panning variable and the
mouse_panning_rate( ) primitive work together to support
panning and auto-scroll with the Microsoft
IntelliMouse (or any other
three button mouse).  The EEL subroutine that receives clicks of the
third mouse button sets mouse_panning nonzero to tell Epsilon to
begin panning and record the initial position of the mouse.

Then the subroutine can regularly call mouse_panning_rate( ) to
determine how quickly, and in what direction, to scroll.  The
parameter percent specifies the percentage of the screen the
mouse has to travel to reach maximum speed (usually 40%).  The
parameter slow specifies the minimum speed in milliseconds per
screen line (usually 2000 ms/line).  The parameter fast specifies
the maximum speed in milliseconds per screen line (usually 1 ms/line).

The mouse_panning_rate( ) primitive uses these figures, plus the
current position of the mouse, to return the scroll rate in
milliseconds per screen line.  It returns a positive number if
Epsilon should scroll down, a negative number to scroll up, or zero
if Epsilon should not scroll.

See the previous section for information on what happens when you
roll the wheel on a wheeled mouse instead of clicking it.

3Window Events

 PWIN_EXIT, textual macro PWIN_DRAG_DROP, textual macro PWIN_MENU_SELECT, textual macroMWIN_EXITMWIN_DRAG_DROPMWIN_MENU_SELECTRwinkeysWhen an EEL function calls getkey( ) to retrieve
the next key, it sometimes receives a key code that doesn't
correspond to any actual key, but represents some other kind of input
event.  Mouse keys (see Rmousekeysπmousekeys) are one example of
this.  This section describes the other key codes Epsilon uses for
input events.  These keys only occur in the Windows version.

The WIN_MENU_SELECT key indicates that the user selected an
item from a menu or the tool bar.  Epsilon sets the variable
menu_command≈menu_command to the name of the selected command whenever it
returns this key.

The WIN_DRAG_DROP key indicates that the user has just
dropped a file on one of Epsilon's windows, or that Epsilon has
received a DDE message from another program.  See the description of
the drag_drop_result( ) primitive in Rdragdropresultπdragdropresult.

The WIN_EXIT key indicates that the user has tried to close
Epsilon, by clicking on the close box, for example.

MWIN_HELP_REQUEST PWIN_HELP_REQUEST, textual macroThe WIN_HELP_REQUEST key indicates that the user has just
pushed a button in Epsilon's help file to set a particular variable
or run a command.  Epsilon fills the menu_command≈menu_command variable
with the message from the help system.

MGETFOCUSMLOSEFOCUS PGETFOCUS, textual macro PLOSEFOCUS, textual macroThe GETFOCUS and LOSEFOCUS keys indicate that a
particular screen has gained or lost the focus.  These set
mouse_screen just like mouse keys.  (See Rmousescreenπmousescreen.)

MWIN_RESIZE PWIN_RESIZE, textual macroThe WIN_RESIZE key indicates that Epsilon has resized a screen.
Sometimes Epsilon will resize the screen without returning this key.

MWIN_VERT_SCROLLscrollbar_handler() PWIN_VERT_SCROLL, textual macro Pscrollbar_handler(), subroutineThe WIN_VERT_SCROLL key indicates that Epsilon has scrolled
a window.  Epsilon doesn't normally return keys for these events.
Instead, Epsilon calls the EEL subroutine
scrollbar_handler( ) from within the wait_for_key( )
function, passing it information on which scroll bar was clicked,
which part of the scroll bar was selected, and so forth.

Rpermit-window-keysEpsilon only recognizes user attempts to
scroll by clicking on the scroll bar, or to resize the window, when
it waits for a key in a recursive edit level.  When an EEL command
requests a key, Epsilon normally ignores attempts to scroll, and
postpones acting on resize attempts.

MWIN_WHEEL_KEY PPERMIT_SCROLL_KEY, textual macro PPERMIT_RESIZE_KEY, textual macro PPERMIT_WHEEL_KEY, textual macro PWIN_WHEEL_KEY, textual macroAn EEL command can set the permit_window_keys≈permit_window_keys variable to
allow these things to happen immediately, and possibly redraw the
screen.  Bits in the variable control these activities: set the
πMPERMIT_SCROLL_KEY bit to permit immediate scrolling, and set
πMPERMIT_RESIZE_KEY to permit resizing.  Setting
πMPERMIT_SCROLL_KEY also makes Epsilon return the
WIN_VERT_SCROLL key shortly after scrolling.  Setting the
πMPERMIT_WHEEL_KEY bit tells Epsilon to generate a
WIN_WHEEL_KEY key event after scrolling due to a wheel roll
on a Microsoft IntelliMouse.

MWIN_BUTTON PWIN_BUTTON, textual macroThe WIN_BUTTON key indicates that the user has clicked on a
button in a dialog box, or selected the button via the keyboard.  By
default, Epsilon translates each button to a standard key like
Ctrl-M.  An EEL program can set the variable return_raw_buttons
to disable this translation and instead receive WIN_BUTTON keys
for each button pressed.

3Completion

There are several EEL subroutines defined in complete.e that get a
line of input from the user, allowing normal editing.  Most of them
offer some sort of completion as well.  They also provide a command
history.

Each function takes two or three arguments.  The first argument is an
array of characters in which to store the result.  The second
argument is a prompt string to print in the echo area.  The third
argument, if there is one, is the default string.  Depending on the
setting of the insert-default-response variable, Epsilon may
insert this string after the prompt, highlighted, or it may be
available by pressing Ctrl-R or Ctrl-S.

Some functions will substitute the default string if you press
⁄Enter€ without typing any response.  These functions display the
default to you inside square brackets [ ] (whenever they don't
actually pre-type the default after the prompt).  The prompt that you
must provide to these functions shouldn't include the square
brackets, or the colon and space that typically ends an Epsilon
prompt.  The function will add these on before it displays the
prompt.  If there should be no default, use the empty string "".

Ωget_file()get_file_dir() Pget_file(), subroutine Pget_file_dir(), subroutineget_file(char *res, char *pr, char *def)≤get_file_dir(char *res, char *pr)≤æ≤
The get_file( ) and get_file_dir( ) subroutines
provide file name completion.  When the get_file( ) subroutine
constructs its prompt, it begins with the prompt string pr, then
appends a colon ":" and a space.  (If
insert-default-response is zero, it also includes the default
value in the prompt, inside square brackets.)  If the user presses
⁄Enter€ without typing any response, get_file( ) copies the
default def to the response string res.

The get_file_dir( ) subroutine provides the directory part of
the current file name, inserted as part of a default response or
available via Ctrl-S or Ctrl-R (see the description of the
prompt-with-buffer-directory variable), but it doesn't display
that as part of the prompt.  It uses the prompt pr as is.  It
doesn't substitute any default if the user enters no file name.  Both
get_file( ) and get_file_dir( ) call absolute( )≈absolute() on
the name of the file before returning (see Rabsoluteπabsolute).

Ωget_buf() Pget_buf(), subroutineget_buf(char *res, char *pr, char *def)≤æ≤
The get_buf( ) subroutine completes on the name of a buffer.
To construct its prompt, the subroutine begins with the prompt string
pr, then adds the default def inside square brackets [ ], and then appends a colon ":" and a space.

Ωget_string()get_strdef() Pget_string(), subroutine Pget_strdef(), subroutineget_strdef(char *res, char *pr, char *def)≤get_strnone(char *res, char *pr, char *def)≤get_string(char *res, char *pr)≤get_str_auto_def(char *res, char *pr)≤get_strpopup(char *res, char *title,≤             char *def, char *help)≤æ≤
The subroutines get_string( ), get_strdef( ), and
the rest each get a string from the user, and perform no completion.
They each display the prompt, and accept a line of input with editing.

The get_strdef( ) routine additionally displays the default
string (indicated by def) and allows the user to select the
default by typing just the ⁄Enter€ key.  The user can also pull
in the default with Ctrl-S, and then edit the string if desired.  While
the other two functions use their prompt arguments as-is,
get_strdef( ) constructs the actual prompt by adding a colon and
space.  If insert-default-response is zero, they also include
the default value in the prompt, inside square brackets.

get_strnone() Pget_strnone(), subroutineThe get_strnone( ) subroutine works like get_strdef( ),
except that the default string is not displayed in the prompt (even
when insert-default-response is zero), and Epsilon won't
replace an empty response with the default string.  Use this instead
of get_strdef( ) if an empty response is valid.

get_str_auto_def() Pget_str_auto_def(), subroutineThe get_str_auto_def( ) subroutine is like
get_strdef( ), except it automatically provides the last
response to the current prompt as a default.

get_strpopup() Pget_strpopup(), subroutineThe get_strpopup( ) subroutine is a variation of
get_strnone( ) that is only available under Epsilon for
Windows.  It displays a simple dialog.  The parameter title
provides the dialog's title, and def provides the initial
contents of the response area, which is returned in res.  If the
user presses the Help button, Epsilon will look up help for the
specified command or variable name or other topic name in its help
file.

Ωget_number()numtoi()strtoi() Pget_number(), subroutine Pnumtoi(), subroutine Pstrtoi(), subroutineint get_number(char *pr)≤int numtoi(char *str)≤int strtoi(char *str, int base)≤char got_bad_number;≤æ≤
The get_number( ) subroutine is handy when a command needs a
number.  It prompts for the number using get_string( ), but
uses the prefix argument instead if one is provided.  It returns the
number obtained, and also takes care of resetting iter≈iter if
necessary.  It also understands numbers such as 0x10 in EEL's
hexadecimal (base 16) format, binary and octal numbers, and character
codes like 'a'.

The get_number( ) subroutine uses the numtoi( )
subroutine to convert from the typed string to a number.  The
numtoi( ) subroutine skips over any spaces at the beginning of
its string parameter, determines the base (by seeing if the string
starts with "0x" or similar), and then calls strtoi( ) to
perform the actual conversion.  The subroutine strtoi( ) takes
a string and a base, and returns the value of the string assuming it
is a number in that base.  It handles bases from 2 to 16, and
negative numbers too.  It stops when it finds a character that is not
a legal digit in the requested base.  Both numtoi( ) and
strtoi( ) are defined in basic.e.

The subroutines get_number( ), numtoi( ), and
strtoi( ) set the variable ¬got_bad_number≈got_bad_number to a
nonzero value if the string they receive doesn't indicate a valid
number.  They return the value zero in this case.  If the string does
represent a number, they set got_bad_number to zero.

Ωget_any(char *res, char *pr, char *def)≤get_cmd(char *res, char *pr, char *def)≤get_macname(char *res, char *pr, char *def)≤get_func(char *res, char *pr, char *def)≤get_var(char *res, char *pr, char *def, int flags)≤æ≤
Epsilon locates commands, subroutines, and variables by looking them
up in its ªname tableº.  See Rnametableπname-table for details.
The subroutines that complete on commands, variables and so forth all
look in the same table, but restrict their attention to particular
types of name table entries.  For example, the get_macname( )
subroutine ignores all name table entries except those for keyboard
macros.  In the following table, * indicates that the subroutine
allows entries of that type.

get_any()get_cmd()get_func()get_macname()get_var() Pget_any(), subroutine Pget_cmd(), subroutine Pget_func(), subroutine Pget_macname(), subroutine Pget_var(), subroutine

These subroutines all substitute the default string if you just press
⁄Enter€ without entering anything.  They also display the default
inside square brackets [ ] after the prompt you provide (if
insert-default-response is zero), and then append a colon
":" and a space.

 Pget_var(), subroutineThe get_var( ) subroutine takes an additional, fourth
parameter.  It contains a set of flags to pass to the
comp_read( ) subroutine, as listed below.

Ωget_command_index() Pget_command_index(), subroutineint get_command_index(char *pr)≤æ≤
The get_command_index( ) subroutine defined in control.e calls
the get_cmd( ) subroutine to ask the user for the name of a
command.  It then checks to see if the command exists, and reports an
error if it doesn't.  (When checking, it allows subroutines and
macros as well as actual commands.)  If the function name checks out,
get_command_index( ) returns its name table index.

Ωget_choice() Pget_choice(), subroutineint get_choice(int list, char *resp, char *title,≤               char *msg, char *b1, char *b2,≤               char *b3)≤int select_menu_item(int resbuf, int menuwin,≤                     int owin, int dir)≤æ≤
The get_choice( ) subroutine provides a way to ask the user
to select one of a list of choices.  The choices must appear in the
buffer list, one to a line.  The subroutine displays a pop-up
window with the indicated title and shows the specified message.

Epsilon for Windows instead displays a dialog with the indicated
title, and doesn't use the message.  It uses the specified button
labels (see the description of the button_dialog( ) primitive in Rbuttondialogπbutton-dialog for details).  The get_choice( )
subroutine puts the user's choice in resp and returns 1.  If
the user cancels, the subroutine returns 0.

If resp is initially nonempty, get_choice( ) will position
point on the first line starting with that text.  If resp is
initially "", the subroutine won't change point in list.

select_menu_item() Pselect_menu_item(), subroutineThe get_choice( ) subroutine uses the
select_menu_item( ) subroutine to handle user interaction.
It takes the window handle menuwin of a window containing a list
of choices and returns when the user has selected one.  The parameter
owin should be the handle of the window that was current before
displaying menuwin.  If resbuf is nonzero, Epsilon will copy
the selected line to the specified buffer.

The parameter dir tells Epsilon how to behave when the user
presses self-inserting keys like "a".  If dir is zero, the
subroutine interprets N and P to move forward and back, and Q to
quit.  Other normal keys are ignored.  If dir is 1 or -1,
and search-in-menu is nonzero, normal keys are added to the
result, and Epsilon searches for the first (if 1) or last (if
-1) item that matches.

completion, adding your ownIt's Rfinderflagseasy
to add new subroutines that can complete on other things.  First, you
must write a "finder" function that returns each of the possible
matches, one at a time, for something the user has typed.  For
example, the get_buf( ) subroutine uses the finder function
b_match( )b_match() Pb_match(), subroutine.

MSTARTMATCHMLISTMATCHMEXACTONLY PSTARTMATCH, textual macro PLISTMATCH, textual macro PEXACTONLY, textual macro PFM_NO_DIRS, textual macro PFM_ONLY_DIRS, textual macroA finder function takes a parameter partial which contains what
the user's typed so far, and a set of flags.  If the
STARTMATCH flag is on, the function must return the first
match of partial.  If STARTMATCH is off, it should return
the next match.  The function should return 0 when there are no
more matches.  The LISTMATCH flag is on when Epsilon is
preparing a list of choices because the user has pressed "?".  This
is so that a finder function can format the results differently in
that case.  If the EXACTONLY flag is on, the finder
function should return only exact matches for partial.  If the
finder function is matching file names, you may also provide the
πMFM_NO_DIRS flag, to exclude directory names, or
πMFM_ONLY_DIRS to retrieve only directory names.

comp_read() Pcomp_read(), subroutineNext, write a subroutine like the various get_ routines described
above, all of which are defined in complete.e.  It should take a
prompt string, possibly a default string, and a character pointer in
which to put the user's response.  It passes these to the
comp_read( ) subroutine, along with the name of your finder
function (as a function pointer).

MCAUTIOUS PCAUTIOUS, textual macroThe comp_read( ) subroutine also takes a flags parameter.
If the CAUTIOUS flag is zero, comp_read( ) assumes that
all matches for a certain string will begin with that string, and
that if there is only one match for a certain string, adding
characters to that string won't generate any more matches.  These
assumptions are true for most things Epsilon completes on, but
they're not true for files.  (For example, if the only match for x is
xyz, but xyz is a directory with many files, the second assumption
would be false.  The first assumption is false when Epsilon completes
on wildcard patterns like *.c, since none of the matches will
start with the * character.)  If you provide the CAUTIOUS
flag when you call comp_read( ), Epsilon doesn't make those
assumptions, and completion is somewhat slower.

MCOMP_FILE PCOMP_FILE, textual macroActually, when completing on files, provide the COMP_FILE
macro instead of just CAUTIOUS; this includes CAUTIOUS
but also makes Epsilon use some special rules necessary for
completing on file names.

MCOMP_FOLD PCOMP_FOLD, textual macroIf you provide the COMP_FOLD flag to comp_read( ), it will
do case-folding when comparing possible completions.

MMUST_MATCHMNONE_OK PMUST_MATCH, textual macro PNONE_OK, textual macroThe MUST_MATCH flag tells comp_read( ) that if the
user types a response that the finder function doesn't recognize,
it's probably a mistake.  The comp_read( ) subroutine will then
offer a list of possible responses, even though the user may not have
pressed a key that ordinarily triggers completion.  The
comp_read( ) subroutine might still return with an unrecognized
response, though.  This flag is simply advice to comp_read( ).
The NONE_OK flag is used only with MUST_MATCH.  It
tells comp_read( ) that an empty response (just typing
⁄Enter€) is ok.

MPOP_UP_PROMPT PPOP_UP_PROMPT, textual macroUnder Epsilon for Windows, the POP_UP_PROMPT flag tells
comp_read( ) to immediately pop up a one-line dialog box when
prompting.  Right now, this flag may only be used when no completion
is involved, and comp_read( ) is simply prompting for a line of
text.

MPASSWORD_PROMPT PPASSWORD_PROMPT, textual macroThe PASSWORD_PROMPT flag tells comp_read( ) to display
each character of the response as a * character.  When the
Internet functions prompt for a password they use this flag.

MSPACE_VALID PSPACE_VALID, textual macroThe SPACE_VALID flag tells comp_read( ) that a
⁄Space€ character is valid in the response.  Since ⁄Space€ is
also a completion character, comp_read( ) tries to guess whether
to add a ⁄Space€ or complete, by examining possible matches.

A finder function receives any of the above flags that were passed to
comp_read( ), so it can alter its behavior if it wants.

prompt_comp_read() Pprompt_comp_read(), subroutineThe comp_read( ) subroutine uses the prompt you supply as-is.
Usually, the prompt should end with a colon and a space, like
"Find file: ".  By contrast, the prompt_comp_read( )
subroutine adds to the supplied prompt by showing the default value
inside square brackets, when insert-default-response is zero.
The prompt string you supply to it should not end with a colon and
space, since Epsilon will add these.  If you provide a prompt such as
"Buffer name" and a default value of "main", Epsilon will
display Buffer name [main]: .  If the default value you provide
is empty or too long, Epsilon will instead display Buffer name: ,
omitting the default.  Whether or not Epsilon displays the default,
if the user doesn't enter any text at the prompt the
prompt_comp_read( ) subroutine substitutes the default value by
copying def to response.

Ωlist_matches()completion_lister Plist_matches(), subroutine Vcompletion_lister, variablechar *(*list_finder)();≤list_matches(char *s, char *(*finder)(), int mbuf)≤int *(*completion_lister)();≤char resize_menu_list;≤æ≤
The comp_read( ) subroutine looks at several variables whenever
it needs to display a list of possible completions (such as when the
user types "?").  You can change the way Epsilon displays the list by
setting these variables.  Typically, you would use the save_var
statement to temporarily set one of these while your completion
routine runs.

By default, Epsilon calls the list_matches( ) subroutine to
prepare its buffer of possible matches.  The function takes the
string to complete on, the finder function to use, and a buffer
number.  It calls the finder function repeatedly (passing it the
πMLISTMATCH flags) and puts the resulting matches into the
indicated buffer, after sorting the matches.  If the
completion_lister function pointer is non-null, Epsilon calls
that function instead of list_matches( ), passing it the same
parameters.  If, for example, you have to sort the matches in a
special order, you can set this variable.

list_finder Vlist_finder, variableIf you simply want a different list of matches when Epsilon lists
them, as opposed to when Epsilon completes on them, you can set the
list_finder function pointer to point to a different finder
function.  The list_matches( ) subroutine always uses this
variable if non-null, instead of the finder function it receives as a
parameter.

An EEL completion function can temporarily set the
resize_menu_list variable nonzero to indicate that if the user
tries to list possible completion choices, the window displaying the
choices should be widened if necessary to fit the widest choice.
This variable has no effect on Epsilon windows within GUI dialogs.

Ωcomplete() Pcomplete(), subroutineint complete(char *response, char *(*finder)(), int flags)≤æ≤
To actually do completion, comp_read( ) calls the
complete( ) subroutine.  It takes a finder function pointer,
flags like πMCAUTIOUS and πMCOMP_FOLD described above, and a
string to complete on.  It tries to extend the string with additional
characters from the matches, modifying it in place.

The complete( ) subroutine generally returns the number of
possible matches for the string.  However, it may be able to
determine that no more completion is possible before reaching the
last match.  For example, if the subroutine tries to complete on the
file name "foo", and encounters files named "foobar", "foobaz",
"foo3", "foo4" and so forth, it can determine on the third file
that no completion is possible.  In this case, it returns 3,
even though there may be additional matches.  It can only "give up
early" in this way when it has encountered two or more matches.  So
when the subroutine returns a value of two or greater, there may be
additional matches not included in its count.

Ωgeneral_matcher()M_MATCH_BUF Pgeneral_matcher(), primitive P_MATCH_BUF, textual macrochar *general_matcher(char *s, int flags)≤æ≤
Epsilon providers a general-purpose finder function called
general_matcher( ).  An EEL function can perform completion
on some arbitrary list of words by putting the list of words in a
buffer named _MATCH_BUF (a macro defined in eel.h) and then
providing general_matcher( ) as a finder function to a subroutine
like comp_read( ).  Call comp_read( ) with the
πMCOMP_FOLD flag if you want general_matcher( ) to ignore
case when comparing.

4Listing Commands & Buffers & Files

 Pname_match(), primitivename_match()Ωint name_match(char *prefix, int start)≤æ≤
Several primitives help to perform completion.  The
name_match( ) primitive takes a command prefix such as "nex"
and a number.  It finds the next command that begins with the
supplied prefix, returning its name table index.  If its numeric
argument is nonzero, it starts at the beginning of the name table.
Otherwise it continues from the name table index returned on the
previous call.  It returns zero when there are no more matching
names.  When comparing names, case doesn't count and "-" is the
same as "_".

ΩRfilematchbuf_match()file_match() Pbuf_match(), primitive Pfile_match(), primitivechar *buf_match(char *pattern, int flags)≤char *do_file_match(char *pattern, int flags)≤#define STARTMATCH      1≤#define EXACTONLY       4≤#define FM_NO_DIRS      (0x10)≤#define FM_ONLY_DIRS    (0x20)≤char *file_match(char *pattern, int flags)≤æ≤
The buf_match( ) and file_match( )
primitives are similar to name_match( ).  Instead of returning a
command index, they return the actual matching buffer or file names,
respectively, and return a null pointer when there are no more
matches.

The buf_match( ) primitive returns one of a series of buffer
names that match a pattern.  The pattern is of the sort that
fpatmatch( ) accepts: * matches any number of characters,
? matches a single character, and [a-z] represents a
character class.  The πMSTARTMATCH flag tells it to examine the
pattern and return the first match; omitting the flag makes it return
the next match of the current pattern.  The πMEXACTONLY flag
tells it to return only exact matches of the pattern; otherwise it
returns buffer names that start with a match of the pattern (as if it
ended in *).

MFM_NO_DIRSMFM_ONLY_DIRS PFM_NO_DIRS, textual macro PFM_ONLY_DIRS, textual macroThe file_match( ) primitive returns one of a series of file names
that match a pattern.  You can use this primitive to expand file name
patterns such as a*.c.  See Rwildcardsπwildcards for details
on Epsilon's syntax for file patterns.  The πMSTARTMATCH flag
tells it to examine the pattern and return the first match; omitting
the flag makes it return the next match of the current pattern.  The
πMEXACTONLY flag tells it to return only exact matches of the
pattern; otherwise it returns file names that start with a match of
the pattern.  Use the FM_NO_DIRS flags if you want to skip
over directories when looking for files that match, or
FM_ONLY_DIRS to retrieve only directory names.

do_file_match() Pdo_file_match(), subroutineInstead of directly calling the file_match( ) primitive, you
should call the subroutine do_file_match( ).  It takes the
same arguments as file_match( ) and returns the same value.  In
fact, by default it simply calls file_match( ).  But a user
extension can replace the subroutine to provide Epsilon with new
rules for file matching.

ΩRabort-file-matchingMEREADABORT PABORT_ERROR, textual macro PEREADABORT, textual macro PABORT_JUMP, textual macroshort abort_file_matching = 0;≤#define ABORT_IGNORE  0   /* ignore abort key & continue */≤#define ABORT_JUMP    -1  /* jump via check_abort() */≤#define ABORT_ERROR   -2  /* return ABORT_ERROR as error code */≤æ≤
By default, the file_match( ) and
do_dired( ) primitives ignore the abort key.  (See Rdodiredπdo-dired for information on do_dired( ).)  To permit
aborting a long file match, set the primitive variable
abort_file_matching≈abort_file_matching using save_var to tell Epsilon what to
do when the user presses the abort key.  If you set
abort_file_matching to πMABORT_ERROR and the user presses
the abort key, this function will return a failure code and set
errno≈errno to EREADABORT.  Set the variable to
πMABORT_JUMP if you want Epsilon to abort your function by
calling the check_abort( ) primitive.  (See Rabortingπaborting.)  By default, the variable is zero, and Epsilon
ignores the abort key until the primitive finishes.

3Dialogs
4Standard Dialogs

 Pcommon_file_dlg(), primitivecommon_file_dlg()Ωshort common_file_dlg(char *fname, char *title,≤                      int *flags, int save,≤                      ?char *filt_str, ?char *cust_filter,≤                      ?int *filt_index)≤short use_common_file_dlg(char *fname, char *title,≤                          int *flags, int save)≤int use_common_file_dialog()≤æ≤
The common_file_dlg( ) primitive displays the Windows Common
Open/Save File Dialog.  The fname parameter should be initialized
to the desired default file name; on return it will hold the file
name the user selected.  The title parameter specifies the title
of the dialog window.  Epsilon passes the flags parameter to
Windows; definitions for useful flag values appear in codes.h.
Windows modifies some of the flags before it returns from the dialog.
If the parameter save is nonzero, Epsilon displays the Save
dialog, if zero it uses the Open dialog.  This primitive uses the
¬common-open-curdir≈common-open-curdir variable to hold the directory that this
dialog should display.

use_common_file_dlg()filter_str Puse_common_file_dlg(), subroutine Vfilter_str, variableThe filter parameters let you specify the file types the user can
select; these are all passed directly to Windows.  Epsilon normally
invokes common_file_dlg( ) through the
use_common_file_dlg( ) subroutine, which uses the filter
definitions in the variable filter_str, defined in
filter.h.  You can edit that file to add new filters.

The variable filter_str has the following format.  It consists
of pairs of strings.  The first string says what to display in the
dialog, while the second is a Windows-style list of file patterns,
separated by semicolons.  For example, the first string might be
"Fortran files" and the second string might be "*.for;*.f77".
In the filter_str definition, each string must be followed by a
"¥0"; this lets Windows separate one string from the next.

use_common_file_dialog() Puse_common_file_dialog(), subroutineThe use_common_file_dialog( ) subroutine examines the
want-common-file-dialog variable and other settings and tells
whether a command should use the common file dialog in place of
Epsilon's traditional file dialog.

Ωfind_dialog()find_datafind_dialog_say() Pfind_dialog(), primitive Vfind_data, variable Pfind_dialog_say(), primitivefind_dialog(int show)≤find_dialog_say(char *text)≤æ≤
The find_dialog( ) primitive displays a find/replace dialog,
when its parameter show is nonzero.  When its parameter show is
zero, it hides the dialog.  While a find/replace dialog is on the
screen, the getkey( ) function returns certain predefined keys to
indicate dialog events such as clicking a button or modifying the
search string.  The _find() subroutine defined in search.e
interprets these key codes to control the dialog.  The global
variable find_data lets that subroutine control the
contents of the dialog.

When a find/replace dialog is on the screen, an EEL program can
display an error message in it using the find_dialog_say( )
primitive.  This also adds an alert symbol to the dialog.  To clear
the message and remove the alert symbol, pass a parameter of "".

Ωwindow_lines_visible() Pwindow_lines_visible(), primitiveshort window_lines_visible(int w)≤æ≤
The window_lines_visible( ) primitive returns the number of
lines of a given window that are visible above a find/replace dialog.
If the given window contains twelve lines, but a find/replace dialog
covers the bottom three, this function would return nine.  If Epsilon
isn't displaying a find/replace dialog, the function returns the
number of lines in the given window.

Ωcomm_dlg_color() Pcomm_dlg_color(), primitiveint comm_dlg_color(int oldcolor, char *title)≤æ≤
In Epsilon for Windows, the comm_dlg_color( ) primitive lets
the user select a color using the Windows common color dialog.  The
oldcolor parameter specifies the default color, and title
specifies the dialog's title.  The primitive returns the selected
color, or -1 if the user canceled.

Ωabout_box() Pabout_box(), primitiveabout_box()≤æ≤
The about_box( ) primitive displays Epsilon's "About" box
under Windows.  In other versions of Epsilon, it inserts similar
information into the current buffer.  The about-epsilon
command uses this primitive.

4Button Dialogs

 Pbutton_dialog(), primitivebutton_dialog()Rbutton-dialogΩshort button_dialog(char *title, char *question,≤                    char *yes, char *no, char *cancel,≤                    int def_button)≤æ≤
The button_dialog( ) primitive displays
a dialog having one to three buttons.  By convention, these buttons
have meanings of "Yes", "No", and "Cancel", but the labels may
have any text.  Set the cancel parameter to "" to use a
dialog with two buttons.  Set both cancel and no to "" if
you want a dialog with one button.  The parameter title specifies
the title of the dialog.  The parameter question holds the text
to display in the dialog next to the buttons.

Set def_button to 1, 2, or 3 to make the default
button be the first, second or third.  Any other value for
def_button is the same as 1.  Canceling or closing the dialog is
equivalent to pressing the last defined button.

The primitive returns 1, 2, or 3 to indicate which button
was pressed.  This primitive only works in the Windows version of
Epsilon; read on for a similar function that works everywhere.

Ωask_yn() Pask_yn(), subroutineint ask_yn(char *title, char *question, char *yes_button,≤           char *no_button, int def_button)≤æ≤
The ask_yn( ) subroutine defined in basic.e asks a Yes/No
question.  Under Windows, it uses a dialog.  The parameters specify
the title of the dialog, the text of the question displayed in it,
and the text on its two buttons (typically "Yes" and "No", but
sometimes "Save" and "Cancel" or the like).

Set def_button to 0 for no default, 1 to make the first
choice "Yes" the default, or 2 to make the second choice "No"
the default.  (Under non-Windows versions, no default means that just
hitting ⁄Enter€ won't return from this function; you must choose
an option.  Under Windows, no default is the same as a default of
"Yes".)  The function returns 1 if the user selected the first
option "Yes" or 0 if the user selected the section option
"No".  Non-Windows versions of Epsilon only use the question
and def_button parameters.  They modifies the prompt to indicate
the default, if any.

4Windowed Dialogs

 Pdisplay_dialog_box(), primitivedisplay_dialog_box()Rdisplay-dialog-boxΩdisplay_dialog_box(char *dialogname, char *title,≤                   int win1, int win2, int win3,≤                   char *button1, char *button2, char *button3)≤æ≤
The display_dialog_box( )
primitive creates a new dialog box in Epsilon for Windows containing
one or more Epsilon windows.  The dialogname must correspond to
one of the dialogs in this list:

Ω– 2 c14 36 c49 Dialog nameWindowsDialog nameWindowsAskExitBox2GeneralBox1AskSaveBox2HelpSetup11CaptionBox2OneLineBox1EditVarBox2PromptBox2FileDateBox1SetColorBox3FileDateBox21UsageBox1—æ

Each dialog requires one to three handles to pop-up windows, created
with add_popup( ) in the usual way.  The primitive moves these
windows to the new dialog box.  If you use a dialog which requires
only one or two window handles, provide zero for the remaining
handles.  The windows will be resized to fit the dialog, and each
will be assigned a unique "screen handle".  Mouse clicks in that
window will set the mouse_screen variable to the matching
screen handle.  You can use the window_to_screen( ) primitive to
determine the screen number assigned to each window.

The parameters button1, button2, and button3 specify the
text for the buttons.  If you want fewer buttons, provide the value
"" for button2 or button3 and that button will not
appear.  The specified title appears at the top of the dialog box.

MHELPKEY PHELPKEY, textual macroWhen you click on a button in a dialog, Epsilon normally returns a
particular fixed keystroke: either Ctrl-M, or the abort key specified
by the abort_key variable, or the help key specified by the
HELPKEY macro, for the first, second, and third buttons
respectively.  These correspond to typical button labels of "OK",
"Cancel", and "Help", so that most EEL programs don't need to do
anything special to receive input from buttons.  If an EEL program
needs to know whether a keypress came from an actual key, or a
button, it can examine the value of the key_is_button≈key_is_button
variable.  This variable is zero whenever the last key returned was
an actual key, and nonzero when it was really a button.  In the
latter case, its value is 1 if the leftmost button was pressed,
2 if the next button was pressed, and so forth.

Sometimes an EEL program puts different labels on the buttons.  It
can be more convenient in this case to retrieve a button press as a
distinct key.  Set the ¬return_raw_buttons≈return_raw_buttons variable to a
nonzero value to retrieve all button presses as the key code
πMWIN_BUTTON.  The key_is_button≈key_is_button variable will still be set
as described above, so you can distinguish one button from another by
examining its value.

The subroutines one_window_to_dialog( ),
prompt_box( ), and two_scroll_box( ) each call
display_dialog_box( ) with some of its parameters filled in for
you.  They display certain common kinds of dialogs.  Call
one_window_to_dialog( ) to display a dialog with a single text
window and one to three buttons.  To see an example, define a
bookmark with Alt-/ and then type Alt-X list-bookmarks.  Call
prompt_box( ) to display a dialog with a one-line window, and
below it a list-box style window.  To see an example, type Ctrl-X
Ctrl-F and then '?'.  Call two_scroll_box( ) to display a dialog
box with two multi-line windows.

Ωnext_dialog_item()prev_dialog_item() Pnext_dialog_item(), primitive Pprev_dialog_item(), primitivenext_dialog_item()≤prev_dialog_item()≤æ≤
Within an Epsilon window that's part of a dialog box, the
next_dialog_item( ) and prev_dialog_item( )
primitives move the focus to a different window or button within the
dialog box.  Epsilon normally binds ⁄Tab€ and Shift-⁄Tab€ to
commands that use these primitives.

ΩRsetwindowcaptionset_window_caption()show_window_caption() Pset_window_caption(), primitive Pshow_window_caption(), subroutineset_window_caption(int win, char *title)≤show_window_caption()≤æ≤
The set_window_caption( ) primitive
sets the text in the title bar of the dialog box containing the
window win.  If the specified window is on Epsilon's main screen,
it sets the main window title displayed above the menu bar.  The
show_window_caption( ) subroutine calls this to include the
current file name in the caption of Epsilon's main window.

3The Main Loop

main loopRloopWhile Epsilon runs, it repeatedly gets keys, executes the
commands bound to them, and displays any changes to buffers that
result.  We call this process the ªmain loopº.  Epsilon loops
until you call the leave_recursion( )≈leave_recursion() primitive, as described
in Rexitrecurπexitrecur.  The steps in the main loop are as
follows:

 Epsilon resets the in_echo_area≈in_echo_area variable.  See Rinechoareaπinechoarea.

 Epsilon calls the check_abort( )≈check_abort() primitive to see if you
pressed the abort key since the last time check_abort( )≈check_abort() was
called.  If so, an abort happens.  See Rabortingπaborting.

 Epsilon sets the current buffer to be the buffer connected to the
current window.

 Epsilon calls maybe_refresh( )≈maybe_refresh(), so that all windows are
brought up to date if the next key is not ready yet.

 Epsilon calls undo_mainloop( )≈undo_mainloop(), to make sure undo
information is kept for the current buffer, and to tell the undo
system that future buffer changes will be part of the next command.

 Epsilon sets the this_cmd≈this_cmd and has_arg≈has_arg variables
to 0, and the iter≈iter variable to 1.  See below.

  Pgetkey(), subroutineEpsilon calls the EEL subroutine getkey( ).  This
subroutine in turn calls the wait_for_key( )≈wait_for_key() primitive to wait
for the next key, mouse click, or other event.

 Epsilon executes the new key by calling the primitive
do_topkey( )≈do_topkey() as described in Rdotopkeyπdotopkey.

 Epsilon sets the prev_cmd≈prev_cmd variable to the value in
this_cmd≈this_cmd.



Ωinvisible_cmd() Pinvisible_cmd(), primitiveuser short this_cmd;≤user short prev_cmd;≤invisible_cmd()≤æ≤
Some commands behave differently depending on what command preceded
them.  For example, up-line behaves differently
when the previous command was also up-line.  To get this
behavior, the command acts differently if prev_cmd≈prev_cmd is set to a
certain value and sets this_cmd≈this_cmd to that value itself.  Epsilon
copies the value in this_cmd to prev_cmd and then
clears this_cmd, each time through the main loop.

Sometimes a command doesn't wish to be counted when determining the
previous command.  For example, when you move the mouse, Epsilon is
actually running a command.  But the up-line command of the
previous example must behave the same, whether or not you happen to
move the mouse between one up-line and the next.  A command
may call the invisible_cmd( ) primitive to make commands
like up-line ignore it.  (In fact, the primitive simply sets
this_cmd equal to prev_cmd.)

ΩRiteruser char has_arg;≤user int iter;≤æ≤

Numeric arguments work using the has_arg≈has_arg and iter≈iter
variables.  The main loop resets iter to 1 and has_arg
to 0.  The argument command sets iter to the value
of the argument, and sets has_arg to 1 so other commands
can distinguish an argument of 1 from no argument.  The
do_command( )≈do_command() primitive, described in Rdocommandπdocommand,
will repeatedly execute a command while iter's value is greater
than one, subtracting one from iter's value with each execution.
If a command wants to handle arguments itself, it must set iter
to one or less before returning, or the main loop will call it again.

Ωuser short cmd_len;≤æ≤
Any command may get more keys using the wait_for_key( )≈wait_for_key() primitive
(usually by calling getkey( ); see Rgetkeyπgetkey).
Epsilon counts the keys used so far by the current command and stores
the value in the variable cmd_len≈cmd_len.  This counter is reset each
time Epsilon goes through the main loop.

3Binding Primitives

 PNUMKEYS, textual macrokey tablekeytableMNUMKEYSEpsilon lets each buffer have a different set of key bindings
appropriate to editing the type of text in that buffer.  For
instance, while in a buffer with EEL source code, a certain key could
indent the current function.  The same key might indent a paragraph
in a buffer with text.

A key table stores a set of key bindings.  A key table is an array,
with one entry for each key on the keyboard.  Each entry in the array
contains an index into the name table.  (See Rnametableπname-table.)  If the value of a particular entry is negative
or zero, it means the key is undefined according to that table.  The
file eel.h defines a macro called NUMKEYS that provides the
number of bindable keys on the keyboard.  A key table, then, is an
array of NUMKEYS short ints.

Ωmode_keysroot_keyscx_tab Pmode_keys, primitive Proot_keys, primitive Vcx_tab, variablebuffer short *mode_keys;≤short *root_keys;≤æ≤
Epsilon uses two key tables in its search for the binding of a key.
First it looks in the key table referenced by the buffer-specific
variable mode_keys.  If the entry for the key is negative,
Epsilon considers the command unbound and signals an error.  If the
entry for the key is 0, as it usually is, Epsilon uses the entry
in the key table referenced by the variable root_keys instead.
If the resulting entry is zero or negative, Epsilon considers the key
unbound.  If it finds an entry for the key that is a positive number,
Epsilon considers that number the key's binding.  The number is
actually an index into the name table.

Most entries in a key table refer to commands, but an entry may also
refer to a subroutine (if it takes no arguments), to a keyboard
macro, or to another key table.  For example, the entry for Ctrl-X in
the default key table refers to a key table named cx_tab,
which contains the Ctrl-X commands.  The entry for the
find-file command bound to Ctrl-X Ctrl-F appears in the
cx_tab key table.

Ωnew_table()make_anon_keytable()index_table() Ekeytable, EEL keyword Pnew_table(), primitive Pmake_anon_keytable(), subroutine Pindex_table(), primitiveint new_table(char *name)≤int make_anon_keytable()            /* control.e */≤short *index_table(int index)≤æ≤
Key tables are usually defined with the keytable keyword as
described in Rkeytableπkeytable.  If a key table's name is not
known when the routine is compiled, the new_table( ) primitive
can be used.  It makes a new key table with the given name.  All
entries in it are 0.

The make_anon_keytable( ) subroutine defined in control.e
calls new_table( ), first choosing an unused name for the table.
The index_table( ) function takes a name table index and
retrieves the key table it refers to.

Ωfix_key_table()set_case_indirect()set_list_keys() Pfix_key_table(), subroutine Pset_case_indirect(), subroutine Pset_list_keys(), subroutinefix_key_table(short *ftab, int fval, short *ttab, int tval)≤set_case_indirect(short *tab)≤set_list_keys(short *tab)≤æ≤
The fix_key_table( ) subroutine copies key table information
from one key table to another.  For each key in ftab bound to
the function fval, the subroutine binds that key in ttab to
the function tval.

The set_case_indirect( ) subroutine sets the upper case
letter keys in a key table to indirect through their lower case
equivalents.  The set_list_keys( ) subroutine does that, and
also sets the "n" and "p" keys to move up or down by lines.

Ωdo_topkey()Rdotopkeyrun_topkey()Rdocommand Pdo_topkey(), primitive Prun_topkey(), subroutinedo_topkey()≤run_topkey()≤æ≤
When Epsilon is ready to execute a key in its main loop, it calls the
primitive do_topkey( ). This primitive
searches the key tables for the command bound to the current key, as
described above.  When it has found the name table index, it calls
do_command( )≈do_command(), below, to interpret the command.

The run_topkey( ) subroutine provides a wrapper around
do_topkey( ) that resets iter and similar variables like
the main loop does.  An EEL subroutine that wants to retrieve keys
itself and execute them as if the user typed them at command level
can call this subroutine.

Ωdo_command() Pdo_command(), primitivedo_command(int index)≤user short last_index;≤æ≤
The do_command( ) primitive executes the command or other
item with the supplied name table index.  If the index is invalid,
then the quick_abort( )≈quick_abort() primitive is called.  Otherwise, the
index is copied to the last_index≈last_index variable, so the help system
can find the name of the current command (among other uses).

If the name table index refers to a command or subroutine, Epsilon
calls the function.  When it returns, Epsilon checks the
iter≈iter variable.  If it is two or more, Epsilon proceeds to call
the same function repeatedly, decrementing iter≈iter each time, so
that it calls the function a total of iter≈iter times.  See Riterπiter.

If the entry in the name table that do_command( )≈do_command() is to execute
contains another table, Epsilon gets another key.  First, Epsilon
updates the primitive array table_keys.  It contains the
prefix keys entered so far in the current command, and
table_count≈table_count contains their number.  Next, Epsilon calls the
EEL subroutine table_prompt( ) if it exists to display a prompt
for the new key.  The version of this subroutine that's provided with
Epsilon uses mention( )≈mention(), so the message may not appear
immediately.  Epsilon then calls the EEL subroutine getkey( )
to read a new key and clears the echo area of the prompt.  Epsilon
then interprets the key just as the do_topkey( )≈do_topkey() primitive
would, but using the new key table.  If both mode_keys≈mode_keys and
root_keys≈root_keys provided a table as the entry for the first key, the
values from each are used as the new mode and root key tables.

Ωdo_again() Pdo_again(), primitivedo_again()≤æ≤
The do_again( ) primitive reinterprets a key using the same
pair of mode and root tables that were used previously.  The value in
the variable key≈key may, of course, be different.  Epsilon uses
this primitive in commands such as alt-prefix.

Epsilon handles EEL subroutines without parameters in the name table
in the same way as commands, as described above.  If the entry is for
a keyboard macro, the only other legal name table entry, Epsilon goes
into a recursive edit level and begins processing the keys in the
macro.  It saves the macro internally so that future requests for a
key will return characters from the macro, as described in Rgetkeyπgetkey.  It also saves the value of iter≈iter, so the macro
will iterate properly.  When the macro runs out of keys, Epsilon
automatically exits the recursive edit level, and returns from the
call to do_again( ).  (When ¬macro-runs-immediately≈macro-runs-immediately is
nonzero, running a macro doesn't enter a recursive edit level, but
returns immediately.  Future key requests will still come from the
macro until it's exhausted.)

Ωshort ignore_kbd_macro;≤æ≤
Epsilon provides a way for a keyboard macro to suspend itself and
get input from the user, then continue.  Set the
¬ignore_kbd_macro≈ignore_kbd_macro variable nonzero to get keyboard input even
when a macro is running.  The pause-macro command uses this
variable.

Ωask_key()key_binding Pask_key(), subroutine Vkey_binding, variableshort *ask_key(char *pr, char *keyname) /* basic.e */≤short key_binding[30];      // ask_key() puts key info here≤æ≤
The ask_key( ) subroutine defined in basic.e duplicates the
logic of the main loop in getting the sequence of keys that make up a
command.  However, it prompts for the sequence and doesn't run the
command at the end.  Commands like bind-to-key
that ask for a key and accept a sequence of key table keys
use it.

The ask_key( ) subroutine returns a pointer to the entry in the
key table that was finally reached.  The value pointed to is the name
table index of the command the key sequence invokes.

This subroutine stores the key sequence in the keyname parameter
in text form (as "Ctrl-X f", for example).  It also copies the key
sequence into the global variable key_binding.  The key
sequence is in macro format, so in the example of Ctrl-X f,
key_binding[1] would hold CTRL('X'), key_binding[2] would
hold 'f', and key_binding[0] would hold 3, the total number
of entries in the array.

Ωfull_getkey()MCTRLIFY_KEY Pfull_getkey(), subroutine PCTRLIFY_KEY, textual macrofull_getkey(char *pr, int code)        /* basic.e */≤≤    /* for full_getkey() */≤#define ALTIFY_KEY      1≤#define CTRLIFY_KEY     2≤æ≤
The full_getkey( ) subroutine defined in basic.e gets a single
key from the keyboard, but recognizes the prefix keys ⁄Esc€ and
Ctrl-^.  The ask_key( ) subroutine uses it, as well as the
commands bound to the prefix keys above.  It takes a prompt to
display and a bit pattern (from eel.h) to make it act as if certain
of the above keys had already been typed.  For example, the
ctrl-prefix command calls this subroutine with the value
CTRLIFY_KEY.  It leaves the key that results in the key
primitive.

Ωname_macro() Pname_macro(), primitivename_macro(char *name, short *keys)≤æ≤
Epsilon has no internal mechanism for capturing keyboard keys to
build a macro (this is done in the getkey( ) subroutine defined
in control.e), but once a macro has been built Epsilon can name it and
make it accessible with the name_macro( ) function.  It takes the
name of the macro to create, and the sequence of keys making up
the macro in an array of short ints.  This array is in the same
format that get_keycode( )≈get_keycode() uses.  That is, the first element of
the array contains the number of valid elements in the array
(including the first one).  The actual keys in the macro follow.  The
name_macro( )≈name_macro() primitive makes a copy of the macro it is given,
so the array can be reused once the macro has been defined.

Ωget_macro() Pget_macro(), primitiveshort *get_macro(int index)≤æ≤
The get_macro( ) primitive can retrieve the keys in a defined
keyboard macro.  It takes the name table index of a macro, and
returns a pointer to the array containing the macro.

Ωlist_bindings() Plist_bindings(), primitiveint list_bindings(int start, short *modetable,≤                  short *roottable, int find)≤æ≤
The list_bindings( ) primitive quickly steps through a pair of
key tables, looking for entries that have a certain name table index.
It takes mode and root key tables, the name table index to find, and
either -1 to start at the beginning of the key tables, or the
value it returned on a previous call.  It returns the index into the
key table, or -1 if there are no more matching entries.  For
each position in the tables, Epsilon looks at the value in the mode
key table, unless it is zero.  In that case, it uses the root table.

In addition to the matches, list_bindings( )≈list_bindings() also stops on each
name table index corresponding to a key table, since these must
normally be searched also.  For example, the following file
defines a command that counts the number of separate bindings of any
command.

Ω#include "eel.h"≤≤command count_bindings()≤{≤    char cmd[80];≤≤    get_cmd(cmd, "Count bindings of command", "");≤    if (*cmd)≤        say("The ≥s command has ≥d bindings", cmd,≤            find_some(mode_keys,≤                         root_keys, find_index(cmd)));≤}≤≤        /* count bindings to index in table */≤int find_some(modetable, roottable, index)≤        short *modetable, *roottable;≤{≤    int i, total = 0, found;≤≤    i = list_bindings(-1, modetable, roottable, index);≤    while (i != -1) {≤≤        found = (modetable[i]≤                        ? modetable[i] : roottable[i]);≤        if (found == index)≤            total++;≤        else≤            total += find_some(index_table(found),≤                        index_table(found), index);≤≤        i = list_bindings(i, modetable, roottable, index);≤    }≤    return total;≤}≤æ≤

2Defining Language Modes

 Ekeytable, EEL keywordmode, defining a newThere are several things to be done to define a new mode.  Suppose
you wish to define a mode called reverse-mode in which typing letters
inserts them backwards, so typing "abc" produces "cba", and
yanking characters from a kill buffer inserts them in reverse order.
First, define a key table for the mode with the keytable keyword,
and put the special definitions for that mode in the table:

Ωkeytable rev_tab;≤≤command reversed_normal_character()≤{≤    normal_character();≤    pointø;≤}≤≤when_loading()≤{≤    int i;≤≤    for (i = 'a'; i <= 'z'; i++)≤        rev_tab[toupper(i)] = rev_tab[i] = (short)≤                        reversed_normal_character;≤}≤≤≤command yank_reversed() on rev_tab[CTRL('Y')]≤{≤        ...≤}≤æ≤
Now define a command whose name is that of the mode.  It should set
mode_keys to the new table and major_mode to the name of the
mode, and then call the subroutine make_mode( ) to update the mode line:

Ωsuffix_none()suffix_default()suffix_ subroutines Pfind_it(), subroutine Psuffix_none(), subroutine Psuffix_default(), subroutinecommand reverse_mode()≤{≤    mode_keys = rev_tab;        /* use these keys */≤    major_mode = strsave("esreveR");≤    make_mode();≤}≤æ≤
If
you want Epsilon to go into that mode automatically when you find a
file with the extension .rev (as it goes into C mode with .c files,
for instance), define a function named suffix_rev() which calls
reverse_mode().  The EEL subroutine find_it( ) defined in
files.e automatically calls a function named suffix_»ext…
(where »ext… is the file's extension) whenever you find a file, if
a function with that name exists.  It tries to call the
suffix_none( ) function if the file has no suffix.  If it
can't find a function with the correct suffix, it will try to call
the suffix_default( ) function instead.

ΩRcodecolorhowtosuffix_rev()≤{≤    reverse_mode();≤}≤æ≤
Language modes may wish to define a compilation command.  This tells
the compile-buffer command on Alt-F3 how to compile the
current buffer.  For example, compile_asm_cmd is defined as
ml "%r".  (Note that " characters must be quoted
with ¥ in strings.)  Use one of the % sequences shown in Rtemplatesπtemplates in the command to indicate where the file name
goes, typically %f or %r.

The mode can define coloring rules.  See Rcodecolorinternalsπcodecolorinternals for details.  Often, you can copy
existing syntax coloring routines like those for .asm or .html files
and modify them.  They typically consist of a loop that searches for
the next "interesting" construct (like a comment or keyword),
followed by a switch statement that provides the coloring rule
for each construct that could be found.  Usually, finding an
identifier calls a subroutine that does some additional processing
(determining if the identifier is a keyword, for instance).

A language mode should set comment variables like
comment-start.  This tells the commenting commands (see Rcommentingπcommenting) how to search for and create legal comments in
the language.

The comment commands look for comments using regular expression
patterns contained in the buffer-specific variables
¬comment-pattern≈comment-pattern (which should match the whole comment) and
¬comment-start≈comment-start (which should match the sequence that begins a
comment, like "/*").  When creating a comment, comment commands
insert the contents of the buffer-specific variables
¬comment-begin≈comment-begin and ¬comment-end≈comment-end around the new comment.

Commands like forward-level that move forward and backward
over matching delimiters will (by default) recognize (, [, and µ
delimiters.  It won't know how to skip delimiters inside quoted
strings, or similar language-specific features.  A language mode can
define a replacement delimiter movement function.  See Rmovelevelπmove-level for details.

To let Epsilon automatically highlight matching delimiters in the
language when the cursor appears on them, a language mode uses code
like this:

Ωif (auto_show_asm_delimiters)≤    auto_show_matching_characters = asm_auto_show_delim_chars;≤æ≤
where references to "asm" are of course replaced by the mode's
name.  The language mode should define the two variables referenced
above:

Ωuser char auto_show_asm_delimiters = 1;≤user char asm_auto_show_delim_chars[20] = "{[]}";≤æ≤
The list of delimiters should contain an even number of characters,
with all left delimiters in the left half and right delimiters in the
right half.  (A delimiter that's legal on the left or right should
appear in both halves; then the language must provide a
mode_move_level definition that can determine the proper search
direction itself.  See Rmovelevelπmove-level.)

Finally, a language mode may also want to set things up so typing a
closing delimiter momentarily moves the cursor back to show its
matching pair.  Binding keys like ] and ) to the command
show-matching-delimiter will accomplish this.

Some subroutines help with mode-specific tasks.

Ωcall_by_suffix() Pcall_by_suffix(), subroutineint call_by_suffix(char *file, char *pattern)≤int get_mode_variable(char *pat)≤char *get_mode_string_variable(char *pat)≤æ≤
The call_by_suffix( ) subroutine constructs a function name
based on the extension of a given file (typically the file associated
with the current buffer).  It takes the file name, and a function
name with %s where the extension (without its leading ".")
should be.  For example, call_by_suffix("file.cpp",
"tag-suffix-%s") looks for a subroutine named tag-suffix-cpp.
(If the given file has no extension, the subroutine pretends the
extension was "none".)

If there's no subroutine with the appropriate name,
call_by_suffix( ) then replaces the %s with "default" and
tries to call that function instead.  The call_by_suffix( )
subroutine returns 1 if it found some function to call, or 0
if it couldn't locate any suitable function.

get_mode_variable() Pget_mode_variable(), subroutineThe get_mode_variable( ) subroutine searches for a function
or variable with a name based on the current mode.  Its parameter
pat must be a printf-style format string, with a %s where
the current mode's name should appear.  The subroutine will look for
a function or variable with the resulting name.  A variable by that
name must be numeric; the subroutine will return its value.  A
function by that name must take no parameters and return a number;
this subroutine will call it and return its value.  In either case it
will set the got_bad_number variable to zero.  If
get_mode_variable( ) can't locate a suitable function or
variable, it sets got_bad_number nonzero.

get_mode_string_variable() Pget_mode_string_variable(), subroutineThe get_mode_string_variable( ) subroutine retrieves the
value of a string variable whose name depends on the current mode.
The name may also refer to a function; its value will be returned.
It constructs the name by using sprintf( ); pat should
contain a %s and no other % characters; the current mode's
name will replace the %s.  If there's no such variable or
function with that name, it returns NULL.  The subroutine sets the
got_bad_number variable nonzero to indicate that there was no
such name, or zero otherwise.

Ωguess_mode_without_extension() Pguess_mode_without_extension(), subroutineint guess_mode_without_extension(char *res, char *pat)≤æ≤
The guess_mode_without_extension( ) subroutine tries to
determine the correct mode for a file without an extension, mostly by
examining its text.  It can detect some Perl and C++ header files that lack
any .perl or .hpp extension, as well as makefiles (based simply on
the file's name).  If it can determine the mode, it uses pat as a
pattern for sprintf( ) (so it should contain one %s and no
other %'s) and sets res to the pat, with its %s
replaced by the mode name.  Then it returns 1.  If it can't guess the
mode it returns 0.

Ωmode_default_settings() Pmode_default_settings(), subroutinemode_default_settings()≤æ≤
The mode_default_settings( ) subroutine resets a number of
mode-specific variables to default settings.  A command that establishes a
mode can call this subroutine, if it doesn't want to provide explicit
settings for all the usual mode-specific variables, such as comment pattern
variables.

Ωmaybe_break_this_line()buffer_maybe_break_line Pmaybe_break_this_line(), subroutine Vbuffer_maybe_break_line, buffer-specific variablezeroed buffer (*buffer_maybe_break_line)();≤æ≤
The auto-fill minor mode normally calls a function named
maybe_break_this_line( ) to break lines.  A major mode may
set the buffer-specific function pointer
buffer_maybe_break_line to point to a different function;
then auto-fill mode will call that function instead, for possibly
breaking lines as well as for turning auto-fill on or off, or testing
its state.

A buffer_maybe_break_line function will be called with one
numeric parameter.  If 0 or 1, it's being told to turn
auto-fill off or on.  The function may interpret this request to
apply only to the current buffer, or to all buffers in that mode.  It
should return 0.

If its parameter is 2, it's being asked whether auto-fill mode is
on.  It should return a nonzero value to indicate that auto-fill mode
is on.

If its parameter is 3, it's being asked to perform an auto-fill,
if appropriate, triggered by the key in the variable key, which
has not yet been inserted in the buffer.  It may simply return 1
if the line is not wide enough yet, or after it has broken the line.
Epsilon will then insert the key that triggered the filling request.
If it returns zero, Epsilon will skip inserting the key that
triggered the filling.

The find_c_func_info( ) subroutine gets info on the function or
class defined at point in the current C-mode buffer, by parsing the buffer.
It sets class to the class name of the current item, if any, and func
to the function name if any.  It sets type to "class", "struct",
or "union" if it can determine which is appropriate.  Outside a function
or class definition, the above will be set to "".  You may pass NULL for
any of the above parameters if you don't need that information.

If stop_on_key is nonzero, and the user presses a key while the function
is running, the function will immediately return -1 without setting the
above variables.  Otherwise the function returns a bit pattern:
CF_INFO_TYPE if type was set non-empty; CF_INFO_CLASS
if class was set non-empty; and CF_INFO_FUNC if func was
set non-empty.  In addition to zero, only these combination can occur:

1Error Messages
∆Error Messages

”CmiscThis chapter lists some of the error messages Epsilon can produce,
with explanations.  In general, any error numbers produced with
error messages are returned from the operating system.

Argument list mismatch in call. An EEL function was called
with the wrong number of parameters.  Perhaps you tried to call an
EEL function by name, from the command line.  Only functions that
take no formal parameters can be called this way.

Can't execute auxiliary program »filename…. Under OS/2,
Epsilon needs the file EPS-AUX.EXE to run a concurrent process.  It
must be in the same directory as EPSILON.EXE.  An error occurred
when Epsilon tried to start this program.

Can't find tutorial. Install first. Epsilon tried to load
its tutorial file, since you started it with the -teach option,
but can't find it.  The tutorial is a file named eteach, located in
Epsilon's main directory.

Can't interpret type of »variable-name…. You can only
set or show variables that have numbers or characters in them.

COMSPEC missing from environment. Epsilon needs a valid
COMSPEC environment variable in order to run another program.  See RCOMSPECπCOMSPEC.

Couldn't exec: error »number….  You tried to run a
program from within Epsilon, and Epsilon encountered an error trying
to invoke that program.  The »number… denotes the error code
returned by the operating system.  Also see the previous error.

Debug: can't read source file »filename…. Epsilon's EEL
debugger tried to read an EEL source file, but couldn't find it.
Epsilon gets a source file's pathname from the EEL compiler's command
line.  If you compiled an EEL file with the command "eel
dir/file.e", Epsilon will look for a file named "dir/file.e".
Check that your current directory is the same as when you ran the EEL
compiler.

Don't know how to tag the file »filename…. Epsilon only
knows how to tag files with certain extensions like .c, .h, .e, and
.asm.  Using EEL, you can tell Epsilon how to tag other types of
files, though.  See Reeltagsπeeltags.

Files not deleted. An error occurred when the dired
command tried to delete the file or directory.  You can only delete
empty directories.

Invalid or outdated byte code file »filename…. The byte
code file Epsilon tried to load was created with another version of
Epsilon, was empty, or was illegal in some other way.  Try compiling
it again with the EEL compiler.

»filename… is not a directory. You specified
»filename… in an -fh or -fs flag, telling Epsilon to
create its temporary files there, but it isn't a directory.

Macro definition buffer full: keyboard macro defined. You
tried to define a macro of more than 500 keys from the keyboard.
This might happen because you forgot to close a macro definition with
the Ctrl-X ) command.  If you really want to define such a big macro,
use the command file mechanism (see Rcmdfilesπcmdfiles) or
change the MAX_MACRO constant defined in eel.h and recompile
control.e using EEL.

Macro nesting too deep.  All macros canceled. An Epsilon
keyboard macro can call another keyboard macro recursively (but only
if the calling macro is defined by a command file--see Rmacinmacπmacinmac).  To catch runaway recursive macros, Epsilon puts
a limit on the depth of keyboard macro recursion.  Epsilon allows
unlimited ªtail-recursionº: if a macro calls another macro with its
last keystrokes, Epsilon finishes the original macro call before
beginning the next one.

Only one window. The diff and compare-windows
commands compare the current window with the next window on the
screen, but there's only one window.

RSYS1804LIBPATH, environment variableerror SYS1804eps-lib3.dll
fileSYS1804: The system cannot find the file EPS-LIB3. (OS/2 only.)  If you get this message
when you try to start Epsilon, it means that the file eps-lib3.dll is
not in a directory on your LIBPATH.  The LIBPATH is where OS/2 looks
for any .dll files it needs.  It's specified in the file
¥config.sys on your boot drive, and typically includes the
root directory ¥ of your boot drive.  The file
eps-lib3.dll must be in the correct directory when you start Epsilon,
or OS/2 will give this error message.  Epsilon's installation
procedure puts the file eps-lib3.dll in the directory \epsilon\dll
by default.  Make sure this directory is on your LIBPATH.

config.sys file»function… undefined or of wrong type. Epsilon
initialized itself exclusively from a bytecode file (without reading
a state file), since you gave the -b flag, but that file didn't
define a function or variable that Epsilon needs to run.  See Rafterloadπafterload.  To load a bytecode file, in addition to
Epsilon's usual commands, use the -l flag, not the
-b flag.

when-restoring: »any error… This error may occur when
you upgrade to a new version of Epsilon, recompile some EEL files,
load them into Epsilon, and write out a state file.  Starting Epsilon
with this new state file then produces an error message of this sort.
Most likely, the problem is that you inadvertently included the EEL
header file from a previous version of Epsilon when you compiled the
EEL files.  Recompile them, making sure that you're using the new
eel.h files.  The EEL compiler's -v flag is helpful for
this--it displays the name of each included file.

3Perl Support

Epsilon includes a new full-featured mode for the Perl programming
language.  Like the support for C-like languages, the Perl support
includes the following:

 Syntax coloring, with its own set of color classes for
customization.

 Indentation of code that you type, with variations for
different coding styles.

 Brace and parenthesis matching.

 Smart pasting controlled by the reindent-after-perl-yank
variable.

 Full support for tagging.

 Definition listing and navigation with the new
list-definitions command.



See Rperlmodeπperlmode for details.

3More Use of Syntax Coloring

Epsilon applies syntax coloring to more kinds of files, including
files for Perl, PostScript, GAMS, and assembler.  Epsilon also colors
makefiles, Unix shell scripts, .ini files, and other
configuration files.  This makes it much easier to read many of these
files.  Epsilon also recognizes some variations on existing
modes, such as .idl files.

In addition to looking at any file extension, Epsilon scans the file
and uses various heuristics to determine how the file should be
colored, and what mode to use.  This allows Epsilon to correctly
classify files that lack an extension, which often occurs under Unix.

The process buffers under Epsilon for Unix interpret ansi escape
sequences and appropriately color the output of commands run there,
so they appear nicely colored.

3Easier Commenting of Code

Epsilon makes it easier to write and maintain the comments in your
code.  We extended the functionality of fill-paragraph to
work with comments.  So now you can type Alt-Q to rearrange the line
breaks in your comments to make them pretty.  The command in C mode
analyzes the comment to determine the comment style, and maintains it
during comment filling, even if the number of lines changes.

If you provide a numeric prefix argument to Alt-Q, say by typing
Alt-2 Alt-Q, it rejustifies using the current column as the right
margin.

Similarly, auto-fill mode works within comments, and is enabled by
default.
See Rcommentfillπcommentfill for details.

These commenting features work with the C-like languages and Perl.

3Source Code Navigation

Epsilon provides several new commands that help you determine
how the code you are editing relates to other code.

 Epsilon displays in the window title or mode line the name of
the thing you are editing.  This might be the name of the current
function or procedure in the C-like languages or Perl.  Or for C++
Epsilon displays the name of the class or struct, if point is
inside such a definition.  Epsilon knows about class member
functions, too.

°See the variable display-definition for details.

 You can also have Epsilon list all of the definitions in the
buffer by typing Alt-⁄Quote€, which runs
list-definitions.  This pops up a list of the functions,
classes, and variables that appear in the buffer.  For classes, the
command lists both the class name and any members, appropriately
indented so you can tell which belongs to which.

°You can select one of the definitions to go there, or dismiss the
list with Ctrl-G.  When the list comes up, the item selected is the
definition corresponding to the current place in the buffer.  So a
quick way to go to the top of the current definition is to type
Alt-⁄Quote€ followed by ⁄Enter€.

°The list-definitions command works in all modes that
implement tagging.

 The new Alt-I command displays the #if conditionals in
effect for the current line in the buffer.  By looking at the list
you can tell which preprocessor items must be true and which must be
false, in order for the current line to be included.

°This works in the C-like languages, and also when editing makefiles.

°See the list-preprocessor-conditionals command.

 We made several improvements to the tagging facility.  Tagging
works better with C++ classes and preprocessor conditionals, and
includes structure members.

°With a numeric argument, the tag-files command includes
function and variable declarations, in addition to definitions.
This is useful when you do not have source code to a library and want
to treat a header file as the primary source for definitions.

°Epsilon now automatically retags the current file if it cannot find a
tag.

°The new untag-files command lists all the files referenced by
the current tags file, then lets you delete references to particular
files.



3File Handling

 Ctrl-X Ctrl-L follows a link to a different file named on the
current line.  It works with plain text files, and also understands
#include in C-like buffers, <a href=> in HTML-like
buffers, and corresponding syntax rules in other languages.  See the
find-linked-file command.

 The new locate-file command looks for a file by name,
searching all local drives. For Unix, this command looks through
particular parts of the directory hierarchy; see the
locate-path-unix variable.

 The rename-buffer command lets you rename the current
buffer.  Use this to rename the process buffer under Unix, so that
Ctrl-X Ctrl-M will start an additional process

 The suspend-epsilon command under Unix returns control to the shell that
launched Epsilon.  Use the shell's fg or bg command to resume Epsilon.
When Epsilon runs with X, though, this command instead minimizes Epsilon's
application window.

 The new find-read-only-file command reads a file but won't
permit changing its buffer.

 The new change-file-read-only command lets you toggle whether
or not a file is read-only.



3Running Programs

 You can use the new filter-region command on Alt-|
to process the region between point and mark through an external
command.  By default, the external command's output goes to a new
buffer.  Run filter-region with a numeric argument if you
want the output to replace the current region.

 Under NT, Epsilon now sets its current directory to that of the
concurrent process (as long as you let the command processor cmd.exe use its
standard prompt that includes the current directory).

 Epsilon supports multiple concurrent processes under Unix.
Rename the concurrent process buffer using Alt-x
rename-buffer and the start-process command on Ctrl-X
Ctrl-M will create a second concurrent process.  Epsilon's
compilation commands also use this feature, and compile in a separate
concurrent process buffer.

 By default, the make command now runs in the current buffer's
directory.

 It's now easier to extend Epsilon's error parsing.  Epsilon can now
check a series of regular expression patterns that match possible errors.

 Epsilon for Windows can now send DDE messages to other programs.

 If the process-enter-whole-line variable is 2, Epsilon
copies old lines to the end of the process buffer to make it easier
to repeat commands.



3Epsilon for Unix

 You can use Epsilon's Info reader to read system documentation
provided in info format.  Type F1 I to enter Info, then type D if
necessary to go to the top of the info tree.

 To access system man pages, Epsilon provides a handy ¬man
command.  It prompts for the man item, with completion.  Then it
brings up a nicely colored man page, in a special editing mode.  You
can jump to any other referenced man pages by double-clicking on
them, or by positioning point on them and typing ⁄Enter€.

 Epsilon puts user-specific files (like any session file
or customized state file), in a directory named .epsilon
in the user's home directory.

°When Epsilon needs to find one of its configuration files, it looks
by default in the following places, in order:

°Ω~/.epsilon≤°/usr/local/epsilon»VER…   where »VER… is the current version≤°/usr/local/epsilon≤°/opt/epsilon≤°æ

°You can override this search path by providing an explicit EPSPATH
environment variable.

 With X, Epsilon uses the standard-gui color scheme, which
it also uses under Windows.  Outside of X, Epsilon uses the
xterm-color color scheme if invoked from an xterm, otherwise it
uses the standard-color color scheme.  The xterm-color scheme
inherits the background and foreground colors of the underlying xterm.

 Of course, under Unix the file translation mode defaults to Unix, not DOS.



3Windows Integration

Epsilon has two new add-ins for Windows.

DevStudio Add-in

This add-in makes it more convenient
to use Epsilon alongside Microsoft's Developer Studio, version 5.0 or
later.  It lets you set up DevStudio to pass all requests to open a source
file over to Epsilon.  Here's how:

 Within DevStudio, use the Customize command on the
Tools menu and select the Add-ins and Macro Files page in the dialog.

 Click Browse, select Add-ins (.dll) as the File Type, and navigate to
the VISEPSIL.DLL file located in the directory containing the Epsilon
executable, typically c:¥Program Files¥Epsilon¥bin.
Select that file.

 Close the Customize dialog and a window should appear
that contains an Epsilon icon (a
blue letter E).  You can move the icon to any toolbar
by dragging it there.

 Click the icon and a dialog will appear with two
options.  Unchecking the first will disable this add-in entirely.  If
you uncheck the second, then any time you try to open a text file in
DevStudio it will open in both Epsilon and DevStudio.  When
checked, it will only open in Epsilon.



Desktop shortcut add-in

The add-in provides additional flexibility when you create a desktop
icon for Epsilon, or use the Send To feature of Windows.  The add-in
consists of a program named sendeps.exe, which is installed in
the same directory as the Epsilon executable.  If you create a
desktop shortcut for Epsilon, or use the Send To feature in Windows,
you should have it use this program instead of the main Epsilon
executable.  The sendeps program will locate an existing copy of
Epsilon (or start Epsilon if necessary), then have it load the single file
named on the command line.

We do it this way because Windows ignores a shortcut's command
line when you drop a document on a shortcut, or when you
use the Send To feature.  (If it used the command line, you could simply
create a shortcut to the main Epsilon executable and pass the -add
flag.  Since it doesn't, sending a file requires a separate program.)
Also, Windows sends long file names without quoting them in these
cases, which could also cause problems if sent directly to Epsilon.

Sendeps may be configured through entries in a lugeps.ini file
located in your Windows directory.  The section name it uses is the
same as the base name of its executable.  You can make copies of
the executable under different names to create Send To entries
that behave differently.

The sendeps program uses these default settings:

Ω[SendEps]≤server=Epsilon≤topic=Open≤ddeflags=≤executable=epsilon.exe≤runflags=-add -w1≤æ≤
The sendeps program uses the these settings as follows.  It first
looks for a DDE server named by the server setting.  If found, it
sends the server a command line consisting of the ddeflags
setting, followed by the file name passed on its command line (inside
double quotes), using the specified DDE topic name.  If there is
no such DDE server running, sendeps executes a command line built
by concatenating the executable name, the runflags, and the
quoted file name.

3New CUA Keyboard Support

¿CUA Key Assignments¡

In CUA emulation mode, Epsilon recognizes most of the key combinations
commonly used in Windows programs.  Other keys retain their usual
Epsilon function.

To enable this emulation, press Alt-x, then type ¬cua-keyboard and
press ⁄Enter€.  Use Alt-x ¬epsilon-keyboard ⁄Enter€ to return
to the default Epsilon key assignments.

Various Alt-letter key combinations not mentioned in the figure
invoke menu items (for example, Alt-F displays the File menu in CUA
mode, though it doesn't in Epsilon's native configuration).

Many commands in Epsilon are two-key combinations starting with
Ctrl-X.  In CUA mode, use Ctrl-W instead of Ctrl-X.  For example, the
command delete-blank-lines is normally on Ctrl-X Ctrl-O, but
in CUA emulation you would type Ctrl-W Ctrl-O.

2Enhanced Features in Epsilon 10
3Dired Enhancements

Dired has several new subcommands.
ŒShift-L Mark a file for lowercasing.  Press X to rename the
marked files.

ŒShift-U Mark a file for uppercasing.  Press X to rename the
marked files.

ŒShift-R Mark a file for a regular-expression replacement on
its name.  When you press X to execute operations on marked files,
Epsilon prompts for a pattern and replacement text.  Then, for each
file marked with Shift-R, Epsilon takes the file name and performs
the indicated regex replacement on it to generate the new
name, then renames the file.

¢For example, to rename a group of files like this:

≤¢Ωdir¥file.cxx   => dir2¥file.cpp≤¢dir¥query.cxx  => dir2¥query.cpp≤¢dir¥xyzzy.cxx  => dir2¥xyzzy.cpp≤¢æ≤¢
give these as the search and replace patterns:

≤¢Ω search: dir(.*).cxx≤¢replace: dir2#1.cpp≤¢æ≤
ŒT Display the Windows Properties Dialog for the current
file or directory.  This lets you easily view the size of a directory.

Œ! Prompt for a command line, then run the
specified program, adding the name of the file after it.



The quick-dired-command command on Alt-o is like running a
dired on the file you are editing, then doing a single dired
operation, then discarding the dired buffer.  It prompts for another
key, then performs the indicated action on the file.  The
actions include: D-Delete, M-Move, C-Copy, G-cd to file's
directory, V-run Viewer, F-run viewer on Folder, T-show
properTies.  In addition, ⁄Period€ runs a dired on the file and
⁄Bang€ runs a shell command on the file.  The prompt itself
displays this list, so you don't have to try to remember it.

Finally, dired now displays month names instead of the
numbers it used before.

3Searching & Navigation

 Searches now wrap.  A failing search wraps around to the other
end of the buffer, and displays Wrapping in the echo area.  If
you continue to search and find matches you have already seen,
Epsilon displays Overwrapping. The variable ¬search-wraps≈search-wraps
controls this feature.

 Searching commands no longer have a 255 character limit on the
search string.

 Search strings saved in Epsilon's history list may now contain newlines.

 We changed the way Epsilon indicates your position in the
buffer.  Usually it displays a percentage in the echo area, like it
did before.  But if the top of the buffer is visible in the window,
Epsilon displays Top in place of the percentage.  Similarly, if
the bottom of the buffer is visible, Epsilon displays Bot. If the
entire buffer is visible, Epsilon displays All.  But if point is
at the very end of the buffer, Epsilon displays End instead of
Bot or All.

°To get the previous behavior, modify the mode-end variable
and replace %p with %P.

 The keys Alt-⁄PageUp€ and Alt-⁄PageDown€ now page
horizontally, instead of resizing the window horizontally.

 The new command jump-to-column on Alt-g goes to a
specified column.

 The goto-line command accepts a buffer percentage like
30%, or a line number like before.  You may add a
:»column… number after either, as in 10:20 to go to
line 10, column 20.

 Ctrl-Tab now moves among windows like Ctrl-X N.  Shift-Ctrl-Tab moves
like Ctrl-X P.



3Grep and Multifile Searching

 The commands grep and file-query-replace, when
applied to buffers instead of to files, now understand simple wildcard
characters like *, ?, and [a-z] in the buffer
specification.  To make these commands operate on buffers instead of
on files, give the command a numeric argument.

 Grep now skips over files with certain extensions: .o, .b,
.obj, .exe, and so forth.  Set the grep-ignore-file-extensions
variable to modify this list.

 The grep and file-query-replace commands now
interpret relative file patterns based on the directory of the
current file.  To get the previous behavior, set the
¬grep-prompt-with-buffer-directory≈grep-prompt-with-buffer-directory variable to zero.

 When you halt a file-query-replace by pressing
⁄Period€ or ⁄Escape€ (and not just when you abort it),
Epsilon asks if you want to continue to replace in the remaining
files.



3Regular Expression Enhancements

Previous versions of Epsilon let you write <Tab> or
<#9> to represent special characters, or use the syntax
<#9|Space|;> to match one of a set of characters.
Epsilon now recognizes a few additional names, listed below, that
represent predefined sets of characters.  Some use Epsilon's current
syntax table, which an EEL program may modify, by way of the
isalpha( ) primitive.  Typically this includes accented
characters like Í or Â.

Ω– 2 16 ClassMeaning<digit>A digit, 0 to 9.<alpha>A letter, according to isalpha( ).<alphanum>Either of the above.<word>All of the above, plus the _ character.<hspace>The same as <Space|Tab>.<wspace>The same as <Space|Tab|Newline>.<any>Any character including <Newline>.—æ

You may mix the above class names with other <> character
representations.  For example, <^digit|a-f> matches
any character except of one these: 0123456789abcdef.

Epsilon also recognizes some new assertions.  Like the assertions
^ and $, these don't match any specific characters,
but a potential match will be rejected if the assertion is not true at
the appropriate point in the match.

Ω– 2 20 AssertionMeaning^At the start of a line.$At the end of a line.<bob> or <bof>At the start of the buffer.<eob> or <eof>At the end of the buffer.—æ

For example, searching for <bob>sometext<eob> won't
succeed unless the buffer contains only the eight character string
sometext.

You can now create new assertions from character classes specified
with the angle bracket syntax by adding [, ] or / at the
start of the pattern.

Ω– 2 16 AssertionMeaning<[»class…>The next character matches »class…, the previous one does not.<]»class…>The previous character matches »class…, the next one does not.</»class…>Either of the above.—æ

The »class… in the above syntax is a |-separated list of one or
more single characters, character names like Space or
Tab, character numbers like #32 or #9, ranges of any
of these, or character class names like Word or Digit.

For example, </word> matches at a word boundary, and
<]word> matches at the end of a word.  The pattern
<]0-9|a-f> matches at the end of a run of
hexadecimal digits.  And the pattern
(cat|[0-9])</digit>(dog|[0-9]) matches cat3 or
4dog, but not catdog or 42.

3TeX and LaTeX

 In LaTeX mode, Epsilon now defaults to inserting LaTeX 2e/3
commands, not LaTeX 2.09 commands. Set the latex-2e-or-3
variable to change this.  If you insert a LaTeX environment block and
type the name of a new environment, Epsilon will remember it and
offer it for completion in the future.

 In TeX mode, or whenever the ¬tex-paragraphs≈tex-paragraphs variable is
nonzero, Epsilon now uses slightly different rules for determining
paragraph boundaries.  Previously, lines that started with a ¥ at
the edge of a paragraph were not considered part of the paragraph.
Now such lines are part of the paragraph, but lines starting with
¥begin or ¥end now delimit the paragraph no matter
where they occur.

 In concert with a cooperating Windows DVI viewer, the
jump-to-dvi command on Alt-Shift-J displays the output
resulting from the TeX or LaTeX text near point.

 TeX and LaTeX modes now include a new command on
Alt-Shift-C to set text in small caps.  We also improved the coloring.



3Command Line Flags

 F-vy, command line flag F-vx, command line flag F-vv, command line flag

 The new -vv command line flag instructs Epsilon to split the
screen vertically, not horizontally, when more than one file is specified on
the command line.

 The -vx and -vy flags let you specify the position of
Epsilon's window in Epsilon for Windows.  For example, -vx20 -vy30
positions the upper left corner of Epsilon's window at pixel coordinates
20x30.

 Epsilon for Unix uses the standard X -geometry flag to
position and size Epsilon's window, instead of -vl, -vc,
-vx, or -vy.  Epsilon for Unix also recognizes the standard
X flags -fn or -font to set the font, -display to set
the display, -name to specify the name to retrieve resources
with (instead of Epsilon), -xrm to specify additional resources,
and -borderwidth or -bw to set the border width.  It parses
and ignores the flags -bordercolor, -bc, -background,
-bg, -foreground, and -fg.

  F-vt, command line flagIn Epsilon for Unix, the -vt flag forces Epsilon to run as a
curses-style program, not an X program.  By default Epsilon for Unix
runs as an X program under X, and a curses-style program otherwise.

 You can now tell Epsilon to go to a particular column (as well as line)
from the command line.  Write epsilon +10:20 filename to go to line 10,
column 20, in the indicated file.



3Other Changes in Epsilon 10

 The compare-windows command now ignores whitespace.
See the compare-windows-ignores-space variable.

 Epsilon retains more undo history in all 32-bit versions.  Undo
now restores the unmodified state of a buffer when appropriate, and
displays an indication when passing a buffer-save or buffer-read in
the undo history.  Rereading a buffer is now undoable.  Epsilon
resets the modified flag when undoing or redoing makes the buffer
identical to its most recent saved version.

 In Unix, selecting text with the mouse copies it to a kill
buffer (and the clipboard), like copy-region does.  See the
mouse-selection-copies variable.  In Unix, the center mouse
button yanks text instead of panning.  See the
mouse-center-yanks variable.

 In auto-fill mode, Epsilon will now break the line as soon as
it becomes too long, instead of waiting until you type a ⁄Space€.

 The default tab size outside of C mode is now 8.  It remains 4
inside C mode.

 The fill-paragraph command accepts a numeric argument over 5 as
a temporary margin.  A lower value still means to use an infinite
margin (unfill).

 Epsilon for Windows can draw a focus rectangle around the
current line, for users who have trouble seeing the cursor.  See the
¬draw-focus-rectangle≈draw-focus-rectangle variable.  It can also draw a column
marker at a user-specified column; see the ¬draw-column-marker≈draw-column-marker
variable.

 Epsilon for Windows now uses heuristics to determine whether
its command line contains a single file name containing spaces, or a
series of file names.

 The cd command shows and completes only on directories.

 By default, Epsilon no longer searches for a session file.  If
you want Epsilon to search through the current directory tree as in
previous versions, change the session-tree-root variable.  Some
new variables starting with session- let you customize what
Epsilon restores.

 In bufed, Shift-P prints the current buffer.  Also,
bufed now displays an R to indicate a read-only buffer.

 Printing in Epsilon for Windows now includes margins.  Use the
print-setup command or File/Print Setup from the menu to alter them.
Running a print command with a numeric argument now makes it skip displaying
a dialog.  There are also new variables to include line numbers and
control wrapping.

 The save-all-buffers command on Ctrl-X S now continues if some
files could not be saved, saves the rest, then reports how many files could
not be saved.

 The ⁄Space€ and ⁄Backspace€ keys now page forward and
backward in all read-only buffers. Set the new readonly-pages
variable to zero to disable this.

 Windows Explorer-style file dialogs now retain their current
directory setting from one Epsilon session to the next.

 Internet URL's for http may now include user and password information
for sites that require basic authentication.

 When telnet notices a password prompt, it displays a dialog to hide the
password.  Telnet also interprets some formatting such as underlining
that may appear in command output.

 The auto-quote-allowed variable, used when typing
accented characters, was removed.  Epsilon now handles such
characters differently.

2New EEL Primitives and Subroutines in Epsilon 10
3New File Primitives

read-only files≤Ωint get_file_read_only(char *fname)≤int set_file_read_only(char *fname, int val)≤int set_file_opsys_attribute(char *fname, int attribute)≤æ≤
The get_file_read_only( )≈get_file_read_only() primitive
returns 1 if the file fname has been set read-only, 0 if
it's writable, or -1 if the file's read-only status can't be
determined (perhaps because the file doesn't exist).  The
set_file_read_only( )≈set_file_read_only() primitive sets the file fname
read-only (if val is nonzero) or writable (if val is zero).
It returns 0 if an error occurred, otherwise nonzero.

Under Unix, set_file_read_only( ) sets the file writable for the
current user, group and others, as modified by the current umask
setting (as if you'd just created the file).  Other permission bits
aren't modified.

The set_file_opsys_attribute( )≈set_file_opsys_attribute() primitive sets the raw
attribute of a file.  The precise meaning of the attribute depends on
the operating system: under Unix this sets the file's permission
bits, while in other environments it can set such attributes as
Hidden or System.  The primitive returns nonzero if it succeeds.  See
the opsysattr member of the structure set by check_file( ) to
retrieve the raw attribute of a file.

Ωint fpatmatch(char *s, char *pat, int prefix, int fold)≤æ≤
The fpatmatch( )≈fpatmatch() primitive returns nonzero if a string s matches
a pattern pat.  It uses a simple filename-style pattern syntax: *
matches any number of characters; ? matches a single character, and
[a-z] match a character class (with the same character class syntax
as other patterns in Epsilon).  If prefix is nonzero, s must
begin with text matching pat; otherwise pat must match all of
s.  If fold is nonzero, Epsilon folds characters before comparing
according to the current buffer's folding rules.

Ω PPATH_ADD_CUR_DIR, textual macro PPATH_ADD_EXE_DIR, textual macro PPATH_ADD_EXE_PARENT, textual macrochar *look_on_path(char *fname, int flags, char *path, ?int skip)≤æ≤
The look_on_path( )≈look_on_path() primitive looks for a file along a path.  It's
similar to the lookpath( ) primitive, but more flexible.

First, it fname is an absolute filename, it returns fname if fname
is readable, otherwise NULL.

Next, if flags includes the flag πMPATH_ADD_CUR_DIR, Epsilon
looks for the file in the current directory.

Next, if flags includes the flag πMPATH_ADD_EXE_DIR, Epsilon
looks for the file in the directory containing Epsilon's executable.  If
flags includes πMPATH_ADD_EXE_PARENT, it looks in the parent of
that directory.

Then it looks in each of the directories named by path, a list of
directories separated by semicolon characters (colons under Unix).

As soon as it finds a readable file named fname in one of the above
places, it stops and returns the absolute pathname of that file.  If it can't
locate any matching readable file, it returns NULL.

If you supply look_on_path( ) with an optional skip parameter
of ªnº, it will skip over the first ªnº matches it finds (so long
as its parameter is a relative pathname).  You can use this to reject
a file and look for the next one on a path.

Ω PFSYS_NETWORK, textual macro PFSYS_CDROM, textual macro PFSYS_REMOVABLE, textual macro PFSYS_LOCAL, textual macroint filename_rules(char *fname)≤æ≤
The filename_rules( )≈filename_rules() primitive now returns additional codes
in some cases that indicate the type of drive a file is located on,
when Epsilon can determine this.  πMFSYS_NETWORK indicates
the file is on a different computer and is being accessed over a
network.  πMFSYS_CDROM indicates the file is on a CD-ROM
disk.  πMFSYS_REMOVABLE indicates the file is on a removable
medium like a floppy disk or Zip disk.  And πMFSYS_LOCAL
indicates the file is on a local (non-network) hard disk.  At most
one of the these bits will be present.

Epsilon for Unix returns πMFSYS_CASE_SENSITIVE for all files,
even if they happen to lie on a file system that might use different
rules natively.  It can't detect the type of drive a file is on
either.

3New Buffer Primitives

 Pto_another_buffer(), subroutine≤Ωto_another_buffer(char *buf)≤æ≤
The to_another_buffer( ) subroutine makes sure that buf is not
the current buffer.  If it is, the subroutine switches the current window to
a different buffer.  This subroutine is useful when you're about to delete a
buffer.

Ω Pnormal_on_modify(), subroutinezeroed buffer (*buffer_on_modify)();≤buffer char _buf_readonly;≤æ≤
When a buffer is modified and its call_on_modify flag is set, Epsilon
calls the on_modify( ) subroutine.  By default, that subroutine calls the
normal_on_modify( ) subroutine, which handles preventing
modifications to read-only buffers, among other things.

But if the ¬buffer_on_modify≈buffer_on_modify buffer-specific function pointer is
nonzero for that buffer, on_modify( ) instead calls the subroutine it
indicates.  That subroutine may wish to call normal_on_modify( ) itself.

One of normal_on_modify( )'s tasks is to handle read-only buffers.
There are several types of these, distinguished by the value of the
_buf_readonly variable, which if nonzero indicates the buffer is
read-only.  A value of 1 means the user explicitly set the buffer
read-only.  The value 2 means Epsilon automatically set the buffer
read-only because its corresponding file was read-only.

A value of 3 indicates pager mode; this is just like a normal read-only
buffer, but if the user action causing the attempt at buffer modification
happens to be the result of the ⁄Space€ or ⁄Backspace€ keys, Epsilon
cancels the modification and pages forward or backward, respectively.

Ωzeroed buffer char buffer_not_saveable;≤æ≤
The buffer-specific variable ¬buffer_not_saveable≈buffer_not_saveable, if nonzero,
indicates that a buffer should not be saved, even if it has an associated
file name.  Commands like save-all-buffers try to save any modified
buffer with an associated file name, but skip buffers marked in this way.

Ωzeroed buffer (*buffer_maybe_break_line)();≤æ≤
The auto-fill minor mode normally calls a function named
maybe_break_this_line( ) to break lines.  A major mode may set the
buffer-specific function pointer ¬buffer_maybe_break_line≈buffer_maybe_break_line to point
to a different function; then auto-fill mode will call that function
instead, for possibly breaking lines as well as for turning auto-fill
on or off, or testing its state.

A buffer_maybe_break_line function will be called with one
numeric parameter.  If 0 or 1, it's being told to turn
auto-fill off or on.  The function may interpret this request to
apply only to the current buffer, or to all buffers in that mode.  It
should return 0.

If its parameter is 2, it's being asked whether auto-fill mode is
on.  It should return a nonzero value to indicate that auto-fill mode
is on.

If its parameter is 3, it's being asked to perform an auto-fill,
if appropriate, triggered by the key in the variable key, which
has not yet been inserted in the buffer.  It may simply return 1
if the line is not wide enough yet, or after it has broken the line.
Epsilon will then insert the key that triggered the filling request.
If it returns zero, Epsilon will skip inserting the key that
triggered the filling.

Ω Pbuf_size(), subroutine Pget_buf_point(), subroutine Pset_buf_point(), subroutineint buf_size(int buf)≤int get_buf_point(int buf)≤set_buf_point(int buf, int pos)≤æ≤
The buf_size( ) subroutine returns the size in bytes of the
specified buffer, indicated by its buffer number.  The
get_buf_point( ) subroutine returns the value of point in the
specified buffer.  The set_buf_point( ) subroutine sets point in the
specified buffer to the value pos.

Ω Psimple_re_replace(), subroutinesimple_re_replace(int dir, char *str, char *repl)≤æ≤
The simple_re_replace( ) subroutine performs a regular expression
replacement on the current buffer.  It searches through the buffer, starting
from the top, and passing dir and str directly to the
re_search( ) primitive.  It deletes each match and inserts the string
repl instead.  The replacement text is inserted literally, with no
interpolation.  If you want to use #1 in your replacement text, get a
count of the matches, or other more involved things, call
string_replace( ) instead.

Ω Pmode_default_settings(), subroutinemode_default_settings()≤æ≤
The mode_default_settings( ) subroutine resets a number of
mode-specific variables to default settings.  A command that establishes a
mode can call this subroutine, if it doesn't want to provide explicit
settings for all the usual mode-specific variables, such as comment pattern
variables.

Ω Pright_align_columns(), subroutineright_align_columns(char *pat)≤æ≤
The right_align_columns( ) subroutine locates all lines containing a
match for the regular expression pattern pat.  It notes the ending column
of each match.  (It assumes that pat occurs no more than one per line.)

Then, if some matches end at an earlier column than others, it adds
indentation before each match as needed, so all matches will end at the same
column.

Ω Pget_mode_string_variable(), subroutine Pguess_mode_without_extension(), subroutinechar *get_mode_string_variable(char *pat)≤int guess_mode_without_extension(char *res, char *pat)≤æ≤
The get_mode_string_variable( ) subroutine retrieves the value
of a string variable whose name depends on the current mode.  The
name may also refer to a function; its value will be returned.  It
constructs the name by using sprintf( ); pat should contain
a %s and no other % characters; the current mode's name
will replace the %s.  If there's no such variable or function
with that name, it returns NULL.  The subroutine sets the
got_bad_number variable nonzero to indicate that there was no
such name, or zero otherwise.

The guess_mode_without_extension( ) subroutine tries to
determine the correct mode for a file without an extension, mostly by
examining its text.  It can detect some Perl and C++ header files that lack
any .perl or .hpp extension, as well as makefiles (based simply on
the file's name).  If it can determine the mode, it uses pat as a
pattern for sprintf( ) (so it should contain one %s and no
other %'s) and sets res to the pat, with its %s
replaced by the mode name.  Then it returns 1.  If it can't guess the
mode it returns 0.

Ωreset_modified_buffer_region(char *tag)≤int modified_buffer_region(int *from, int *to, ?char *tag)≤æ≤
Sometimes an EEL function needs to know if a buffer has been modified since
the last time it checked.  Epsilon can maintain this information using tagged
modification regions.

An EEL function first tells Epsilon to begin collecting this information for
the current buffer by calling the reset_modified_buffer_region( )≈reset_modified_buffer_region()
primitive and passing a unique tag name.  Later it can call the
modified_buffer_region( )≈modified_buffer_region() primitive, passing the same tag name.
Epsilon will set its from and to parameters to indicate the range of
the buffer that has been modified since the first call.

For example, say a buffer contains six characters abcdef when
reset_modified_buffer_region( ) is called.  Then the user inserts and
deletes some characters resulting in abxyf.  A
modified_buffer_region( ) would now report that characters in the range 2
to 4 have been changed.  If the buffer contains many disjoint changes,
from will indicate the start of the first change, and to the end of
the last.

The modified_buffer_region( ) primitive returns 0 if the buffer
hasn't been modified since the last reset_modified_buffer_region( ) with
that tag.  In this case from and to will be equal.  (They might also
be equal if only deletion of text had occurred, but then the primitive
wouldn't have returned 0.)  It returns 1 if the buffer has been
modified.  If reset_modified_buffer_region( ) has never been used with
the specified tag in the current buffer, it returns
-1, and sets the from and to variables to indicate the whole
buffer.

The tag may be omitted when calling modified_buffer_region( ).  In
that case Epsilon uses an internal tag that's reset on each buffer display.
So the primitive indicates which part of the current buffer has been modified
since the last buffer display.

Ωset_tagged_region(char *tag, int from, int to, short val)≤short get_tagged_region(char *tag, int pos, ?int *from, int *to)≤æ≤
Epsilon's character color primitives, set_character_color( ) and
get_character_color( ), let you associate a color with a range of
characters in a buffer.  Some new primitives let you associate other
attributes.

Each set of attributes consists of a tag (a unique
string like "my-tag") and, for each character in the buffer, a number
that represents the attribute.  Each buffer has its own set of tags, and each
tag has its own list of attributes, one for each character.  (Epsilon stores
the numbers in a way that's efficient when many adjacent characters have the
same number, but nothing prevents each character from having a different
attribute.)

The set_tagged_region( )≈set_tagged_region() primitive sets the attribute of the
characters in the range from to to, for the specified tag.

The get_tagged_region( )≈get_tagged_region() primitive gets the attribute of the
character at position pos in the buffer.  If you provide pointers
from and to, Epsilon will fill these in to indicate the largest range
of characters adjacent to pos that have the same attribute as pos.

Epsilon's character color primitives set_character_color( ) and
get_character_color( ) use a built-in tagged region with a tag name of
"colors".

3New Process Primitives

 Ppipe_text(), subroutine≤Ωleave(?int exitcode)≤æ≤
The leave( ) primitive now takes an optional parameter to specify an exit
code.  If omitted, Epsilon exits with exit code 0.

Ω PPIPE_SYNCH, textual macroint pipe_text(char *input, char *output, char *cmdline, char *curdir,≤              int flags, int handler)≤my_handler(int activity, int buf, int from, int to)  // Sample.≤int buf_pipe_text(int inputb, int outputb, char *cmdline,≤                  char *curdir, int flags)≤æ≤
The pipe_text( ) subroutine runs the program specified by
cmdline, passing it the contents of a buffer as its standard input, and
inserting its standard output into a second buffer (or the same buffer).

Either the input or output buffer names may be NULL.  Epsilon provides a
current directory of curdir, or uses Epsilon's current directory if
curdir is NULL or "".  The subroutine returns 0 and sets
errno if the function could not be started, or returns 1 if the
function started successfully.

The πMPIPE_SYNCH flag means don't return from the subroutine until
the process has finished.  Otherwise, Epsilon starts the subprocess and then
returns from pipe_text( ), letting the subprocess run asynchronously.

 PPIPE_CLEAR_BUF, textual macroThe πMPIPE_CLEAR_BUF flag means empty the output buffer before
inserting the process's text (but do nothing if the process can't be
started); it's convenient when the input and output buffers are the same, to
filter a buffer in place.

 PPIPE_NOREFRESH, textual macroThe πMPIPE_NOREFRESH flag tells Epsilon not to refresh the screen
each time more data is received from the process, and is most useful with
πMPIPE_SYNCH if you don't want the user to see the data until after it's
been processed.

 PNET_RECV, textual macro PNET_DONE, textual macroIf handler is nonzero, it's the index of a function (or a function
pointer) to call each time text is received from the process, and when the
process terminates.  You must specify an output buffer for a handler to be
called.  The handler function will be called with the buffer number into
which more process output has just been inserted, and from and to set
to indicate the new text.  The parameter activity will be πMNET_RECV
when characters have been received, or πMNET_DONE when the subprocess
has exited.  In the latter case from will hold the process exit code.

The pipe_text( ) subroutine described above is implemented using the
buf_pipe_text( )≈buf_pipe_text() primitive.  There are a few differences between
these:

The buf_pipe_text( ) primitive uses buffer numbers, not buffer names.  It
won't create a buffer for you the way the subroutine will; the buffer must
already exist.  (Pass 0 for a buffer number if you don't need input or
output.)

Instead of passing a function pointer for handler, you must instead set
the buffer-specific ¬when_activity≈when_activity variable in the output buffer
prior to calling buf_pipe_text( ).

Pass a curdir of "", not NULL, to buf_pipe_text( ) to use
Epsilon's current directory.

The pipe_text( ) and buf_pipe_text( ) functions are only available
in Epsilon for Unix and Epsilon for Windows 95/98/NT.

Ωint halt_process(?int hard_kill, int buf)≤int process_input(?int buf)≤int process_kill(?int buf)≤int concur_shell(char *program, char *cline, ?char *curdir, char *buf)≤short another_process();≤int is_process_buffer(int buf)≤æ≤
To support multiple concurrent processes, the primitives
halt_process( )≈halt_process(), process_input( )≈process_input(),
and process_kill( )≈process_kill() now take one additional optional parameter,
a buffer number.  If omitted or zero, the buffer named "process" is
assumed.

The concur_shell( )≈concur_shell() primitive now accepts a current directory
parameter and a buffer name.  If the current directory is null or
both are omitted, Epsilon's current directory will be used for the
new process.  (At this writing, some versions of Epsilon always use
Epsilon's current directory for the new process.)  In versions of
Epsilon that support multiple concurrent processes, the specified
buffer will be used instead of "process".

The another_process( )≈another_process() primitive now returns the number of
active concurrent process buffers, and the is_process_buffer( )≈is_process_buffer()
tells if a particular buffer has a concurrent process.  The
process_exit_status variable provides a process's exit status
code.

Ω Pconcur_activity(), subroutine PNET_RECV, textual macro Pconcur_activity(), subroutinebuffer int (*when_activity)();≤concur_handler(int activity, int buf, int from, int to)≤æ≤
Whenever Epsilon receives process output or sends it input, it calls
an EEL function.  This interface has changed to support multiple
processes; it's now similar to the one used for Internet activity.

The buffer-specific ¬when_activity≈when_activity variable contains a function
pointer to the function to call.  If the variable is zero in a
buffer, Epsilon won't call any EEL function as it proceeds.  For a
typical process buffer, the when_activity variable points to
the concur_activity( ) subroutine.

Just after a concurrent process inserts output in a process buffer,
it calls this subroutine, passing πMNET_RECV as the activity.
The from and to parameters mark the range of buffer text that
was just received from the process.  The concur_activity( )
subroutine responds to this message by coloring the inserted
characters with the color_class process_output color, and similar
tasks.

 PNET_SEND, textual macroEpsilon calls this subroutine and passes πMNET_SEND when it
detects that the concurrent process is now ready for input, and again
as it sends the input to the process.  When the process becomes ready
for input, the subroutine will be called
with a from parameter of zero.  When the process is sent a line
of text, the subroutine will be called with a from of
πMPROCESS_INPUT_LINE, and when the process is sent a single
character it will be called with a from of
πMPROCESS_INPUT_CHAR.  In each case the to parameter will
indicate the beginning of the input text (the value of
type_point before the input begins).

 PNET_DONE, textual macro PPROC_STATUS_RUNNING, textual macroEpsilon calls this subroutine and passes πMNET_DONE when the
process exits.  Its from parameter will hold the exit code, or 0
if Epsilon didn't record this.  Epsilon sets the buffer-specific
¬process_exit_status≈process_exit_status variable to the value
πMPROC_STATUS_RUNNING when a process starts, and sets it to
the process exit status (or 0) when the process exits.

Epsilon for Unix often cannot detect when a process is awaiting
input.  Therefore process_input( ) always returns zero, and a
πMNET_SEND activity will typically not be signaled with a
from parameter of zero.

3New OS-Specific Primitives

Ωint dde_open(char *server, char *topic)≤int dde_execute(int conv, char *msg, int timeout)≤int dde_close(int conv)≤æ≤
Epsilon provides some primitives that you can use to send a DDE Execute
message to another program under Windows.

First call dde_open( )≈dde_open() to open a conversation, providing the name of
a DDE server and the topic name.  It returns a conversation handle, or 0 if
it couldn't open the conversation for any reason.

To send each DDE message, call dde_execute( )≈dde_execute().  Pass the
conversation handle from dde_open( ), the DDE Execute message text to
send, and a timeout value in milliseconds (10000, the recommended value,
waits 10 seconds for a response).  The primitive returns nonzero if it
successfully sent the message.

Finally, call dde_close( )≈dde_close() when you've completed sending DDE Execute
messages, passing the conversation handle.  It returns nonzero if it
successfully closed the connection.

Ωint gethostname(char *host, ?int method)≤æ≤
The gethostname( )≈gethostname() primitive sets host to the computer's
Internet host name and returns 0.  If it can't for any reason, it returns
1 and sets host to "?".  This primitive is only available under Unix
and Windows 95/98/NT.

Epsilon uses the method parameter only under Windows.  If
method is 2, Epsilon asks Winsock for the computer's name.  If
Winsock is set to auto-dial on demand, it's possible that this
request will make it dial.  Any other value for method makes
Epsilon ask Windows itself for the computer's name.  These two
computer names are set in different places in the control panel and
are often different.

Ωsignal_suspend()≤æ≤
In Epsilon for Unix, the signal_suspend( )≈signal_suspend() primitive
suspends Epsilon's job.  Use the shell's fg command to resume it.
When Epsilon runs as an X program, this primitive minimizes Epsilon
instead.

Ωpage_setup_dialog()≤æ≤
Under Windows 95/98/NT, the page_setup_dialog( )≈page_setup_dialog() displays the
standard Windows page setup dialog, which you can use to set printer margins
or switch to a different printer.

3New Input Primitives

 Pwas_key_shifted(), subroutine≤Ωint is_key_repeating()≤æ≤
The is_key_repeating( )≈is_key_repeating() primitive returns nonzero if the user is
currently holding down a key causing it to repeat.  Epsilon can't detect this
in all environments, so the primitive always returns 0 in that case.

Ωint was_key_shifted()≤æ≤
The was_key_shifted( ) subroutine tells if the user held down Shift
when pressing the current key.  Some keys produce the same key code with or
without shift.

Unlike the shift_pressed( ) primitive, which reports on the current state
of the Shift key, this one works with keyboard macros by returning the state
of the Shift key at the time the key was originally pressed.  A subroutine
must call was_key_shifted( ) at the time the macro is recorded for the
Shift state to be recorded in the macro.  Macros defined by a command file
can use an E- prefix to indicate this.

3New Color Primitives

 PECOLOR_COPY, textual macro PECOLOR_UNKNOWN, textual macro≤Ωint get_foreground_color(int colorclass, ?int raw)≤int get_background_color(int colorclass, ?int raw)≤æ≤
The EEL syntax for specifying color choices now provides for default
settings for a color class.  You can specify that a color class
should normally be the same as some existing color class, or that it
should normally use blue text, for example.  You can then override
these settings for particular color schemes, as necessary.

Some new macros πMECOLOR_UNKNOWN and πMECOLOR_COPY in color
definitions represent the new possibilities.  The primitives
get_foreground_color( )≈get_foreground_color() and get_background_color( )≈get_background_color() now
take an optional second parameter to retrieve color settings without
defaulting rules applied.

Ω Pget_color_scheme_variable(), subroutineshort *get_color_scheme_variable()≤æ≤
Epsilon remembers the currently selected color scheme separately for various
environments (graphical environments that support all possible colors, such
as Windows and X; color terminals; monochrome terminals; and the Unix
console).  The get_color_scheme_variable( ) subroutine returns a
pointer to the variable containing a color scheme index that's appropriate
for the current environment.

3Other New Primitives

Ωint muldiv(int a, int b, int c)≤æ≤
The muldiv( )≈muldiv() primitive takes its arguments and returns the value ªa
* b / cº, performing this computation using 64-bit arithmetic.  It's useful
in such tasks as showing "percentage complete" while operating on a large
buffer.  Simply writing point * 100 / size() in EEL would use 32-bit
arithmetic as EEL always does, and on large buffers (over about 20
megabytes) the result would be wrong.

Ω Pfind_c_func_info(), subroutineint find_c_func_info(char *type, char *class,≤                     char *func, int stop_on_key)≤æ≤
The find_c_func_info( ) subroutine gets info on the function or
class defined at point in the current C-mode buffer, by parsing the buffer.
It sets class to the class name of the current item, if any, and func
to the function name if any.  It sets type to "class", "struct",
or "union" if it can determine which is appropriate.  Outside a function
or class definition, the above will be set to "".  You may pass NULL for
any of the above parameters if you don't need that information.

If stop_on_key is nonzero, and the user presses a key while the function
is running, the function will immediately return -1 without setting the
above variables.  Otherwise the function returns a bit pattern:
CF_INFO_TYPE if type was set non-empty; CF_INFO_CLASS
if class was set non-empty; and CF_INFO_FUNC if func was
set non-empty.  In addition to zero, only these combination can occur:

The isalnum( ) subroutine returns nonzero if the specified character
is alphanumeric: either a letter or a digit.  The isident( )
subroutine returns nonzero if the specified character is an identifier
character: a letter, a digit, or the _ character.

Ωint has_feature;≤æ≤
Epsilon provides the ¬has-feature≈has-feature variable so an EEL function can
determine which facilities are available in the current environment.  Bits
represent possible features.  Often these indicate whether a certain
primitive is implemented.

2Changes to EEL Primitives and Subroutines in Epsilon 10

 P_MATCH_BUF, textual macro≤Ωchar *general_matcher(char *s, int flags)≤æ≤
Epsilon now providers a general-purpose finder function called
general_matcher( )≈general_matcher().  (See "Completion Internals" in the manual for a
description of finder functions.)  An EEL function can perform completion on
some arbitrary list of words by putting the list of words in a buffer named
πM_MATCH_BUF (a macro defined in eel.h) and then providing
general_matcher( ) as a finder function to a subroutine like
comp_read( ).

There have been several changes to finder functions and the primitives that
support them:

A finder function traditionally receives a set of flags that may include
πMSTARTMATCH, πMEXACTONLY, and πMLISTMATCH.  Now it also receives
the set of flags provided to comp_read( ), including πMCAUTIOUS,
πMCOMP_FOLD, πMMUST_MATCH, πMPASSWORD_PROMPT and so forth, so it
can alter its behavior if needed.  For one example of this,
general_matcher( ) uses the πMCOMP_FOLD flag that it receives to
decide whether matching should be case-sensitive or not.

The first parameter to the buf_match( ) primitive is now a pattern of the
sort that fpatmatch( ) accepts: * matches any number of characters,
? matches a single character, and [a-z] represents a character class.

MFM_PREFIXMFM_EXACT PFM_PREFIX, textual macro PFM_EXACT, textual macro PFM_NO_DIRS, textual macro PFM_ONLY_DIRS, textual macroThe file_match( ) primitive now accepts a set of flags similar to
other matching functions.  Use πMSTARTMATCH to begin returning a
new set of file names.  Use πMEXACTONLY to return exact matches,
not prefix matches.  (Previously it accepted FM_PREFIX to
begin prefix matching, FM_EXACT to begin exact matching.
Omitting both flags caused it to return another match of the current
pattern.)  The function still accepts πMFM_NO_DIRS to exclude
directories, and now also accepts πMFM_ONLY_DIRS to make it
return only directories.

Mf_all_match() Pf_all_match(), textual macroThe f_all_match() subroutine has been deleted.  The purpose of
this subroutine was to call do_file_match( ), while converting
the set of flags used by completion finder functions into the
corresponding set of flags used by file_match() and related
functions.  Since these two groups now use the same set of flags, you
can now call do_file_match( ) directly without the need for an
intermediate function.

To support older Epsilon extensions, there are macro definitions for
πMf_all_match( ) and the two deleted flags above.

Ω Pdefault_search_string(), subroutinechar *default_search_string(int flags)≤æ≤
The default_search_string( ) subroutine, which returns a pointer to
a default search string, now accepts a flags parameter like other search
functions.  Previously it accepted a Boolean that indicated whether the
regular expression default search string or the conventional default search
string was wanted.

The EEL interface to syntax highlighting has changed.  The highlighting
function for a mode may now indicate that some other part of the buffer
requires highlighting, or that it's colored additional areas of the buffer,
by modifying the "needs-color" tagged region.  See the description of
tagged regions in Rtaggedregionsπtaggedregions.  A mode may specify various
new highlighting options.  See the description of the coloring-flags
variable.

Epsilon's Internet commands previously used functions from an
external DLL called epsnet.dll.  These functions have been moved into
Epsilon.  Several have also changed slightly.

 PETRANSPARENT, textual macroThe ctransparent macro, used with color definitions, is now named
πMETRANSPARENT.

The possible values for the readonly_warning variable now have
macros to represent them.  They indicate what Epsilon should do when
editing a read-only file:

Ω– 2 20 ROWARN_MSGDisplay a message.ROWARN_BUF_ROSet the buffer read-only.ROWARN_BELLRing the bell.ROWARN_GREPPostpone doing any of the above.—æ

1A Note to Our Users

∆Note to Our UsersFor your convenience, we have not put any
annoying copy protection mechanisms into Epsilon.  We hope that you
will respect our efforts, and the law, and not allow illegal copying
of Epsilon.

Under the Copyright Law, if you provide a copy of Epsilon to anyone 
else for any reason, you lose the right to use it yourself.  You may 
under no circumstances transfer the program or manual to more than 
one party.  The Copyright Law says, in part:

Ω    Any exact copies prepared in accordance with the provisions
    of this section may be leased, sold, or otherwise
    transferred, along with the copy from which such copies were
    prepared, only as part of the lease, sale, or other transfer
    of all rights in the program.æ

In other words, treat Epsilon like a book.  If you sell your copy,
don't keep a copy for yourself!

In addition, Lugaru grants the purchaser of Epsilon permission to
install Epsilon on up to two computers at one time, as long as there
is no possibility that Epsilon will be in use on more than one
computer at a time.  The end-user may, for example, install Epsilon
on his or her computer at work and at home, as long as there is no
possibility that Epsilon will be used on both computers at the same
time.  This permission applies to copies of Epsilon purchased by an
end-user and not subject to a written license agreement.

We wish to thank all of our users who have made Epsilon successful, 
and extend our welcome to all new users.

We produced the printed version of this manual using the Epsilon
Programmer's Editor and the TeX typesetting system.  The online Info
and WinHelp versions were generated from TeX source files in Epsilon,
using a set of custom EEL conversion routines that converted the TeX
source to Info or RTF format, generated the index entries, and so
forth.  The online HTML version was generated using EEL conversion
routines and a C++ server program.  Duane Bibby did the illustrations
in the manual.
