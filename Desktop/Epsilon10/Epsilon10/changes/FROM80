New features from Epsilon 8.0 to Epsilon 8.01:

Most dialogs in Epsilon for Windows can now be resized by dragging
their borders.

You can now make the new-file command start its buffers in a
different mode by setting the variables new-file-mode and
new-file-ext.

The printing commands in Epsilon for Windows now understand the
Ctrl-L (form feed) character in documents.  A new variable
print-heading lets you easily customize the heading printed at the
top of each page.

Internet Support
======== =======

Epsilon 9.0 for Windows 95/NT has several commands and facilities
that make it easy for you to edit files on other computers using the
Internet.

The find-file and dired commands, as well as a few others, understand
Internet URL's.  If you do a find-file and provide the URL
ftp://user@machine.com/myfile.c, Epsilon will engage in an FTP
interaction to download the file and display it in a buffer.  All of
the Internet activity happens in the background, so you don't have to
wait for the file to download before continuing with your work.  In
fact, the file appears in the buffer as it downloads (syntax
highlighted if appropriate), so you can be editing the beginning of a
large file while the rest of it downloads.

Saving a file in such a buffer, or writing a buffer to a file name
that starts with ftp://, will cause Epsilon to send the file to the
remote computer.  Upload and download status is indicated in the mode
line, and there's also a show-connections command (on Ctrl-Alt-C)
that shows the status of all Internet activities and buffers.  As in
bufed, you can select a buffer and press <Enter> to switch to it, or
press <Escape> to remain in the current buffer.

The FTP URL's work with dired also, so if you do a dired (or a
find-file) on ftp://user@machine.com, you'll get a directory listing
of the files on the remote machine, in a familiar dired context.
Dired knows how to delete and rename remote files, and sort by size,
date, file name or extension.  There's a new '+' dired key that
creates subdirectories.  It works both locally and remotely.

The new telnet command lets you connect to a command shell on a
remote computer.  It puts you in a buffer that works much like the
Epsilon process buffer, except the commands you type are executed on
the remote machine.  You can either use the telnet command directly,
or specify a telnet: URL to find-file.  (Epsilon ignores any username
or password included in the URL.)

If you specify an http: URL to find-file (for example,
http://www.lugaru.com), Epsilon will use the HTTP protocol to
retrieve the HTML code from the given location.  The HTML code will
appear in an appropriately named buffer, syntax highlighted.

The new finger command prompts for a string like "steven@lugaru.com",
then uses the finger protocol to query the given machine for
information about the given user.  The output appears in an
appropriately named buffer.

URL Syntax
=== ======

In Epsilon, URL's must start with ftp://, http://, or telnet://.  (If
you omit the ftp: part, Epsilon will pass the file name to Windows as
a UNC-style network file name.)

You can specify a user name, password, or port number using the URL
syntax of service://username:password@hostname:portnumber/filepath.
If you include a user name but omit the :password part, Epsilon will
prompt for one (and will make sure the password does not appear in
your state file, session file, or similar places).  But if you
include a password in your URL, note that it may be saved in
Epsilon's session file or similar places.

If you omit the username:password@ or username@ part entirely,
Epsilon uses the user name "anonymous" and the password specified by
the anon-ftp-password variable (default -EpsilonUser@unknown.host).
You can set this to your email address if you prefer.

You can also use Emacs-style syntax for specifying remote file names:
/username@hostname:filepath.  Epsilon will behave as if you had typed
the corresponding URL.

In ftp:// URL's, Epsilon treats a file name following the / as a
relative pathname.  That is, ftp://user@host.com/myfile refers to a
file named myfile in the user's home directory.  Put two slashes, as
in ftp://user@host.com//myfile, to refer to /myfile in the root
directory.  You can type \ instead of / in any URL and Epsilon will
substitute /.

Auto ID of File Types
==== == == ==== =====

Epsilon now automatically determines whether you're editing a regular
file, a binary file, a Unix file, or a Mac file, and uses the
appropriate translation scheme.  You can explicitly override this if
necessary.  This works with both local files and files retrieved
over the Internet.  Epsilon determines the file type by looking at
the first few thousand bytes of the file, and applying heuristics.
This is quite reliable in practice.  However, Epsilon may occasionally
guess incorrectly.  You can tell Epsilon exactly which translation
scheme to use by providing a numeric argument to a file reading
command like find-file.  Epsilon will then prompt for which translation
scheme to use.

The set-line-translate command has been changed to accommodate the
new system.  It now ignores any numeric argument, and prompts for the
line translation scheme to use for the current buffer.

In EEL code, the strip_returns variable has been replaced by the
translation_type variable.  References in older EEL code to
strip_returns.default can often be replaced with the variable
default_translation_type.  Expressions like

	(has_arg ? !strip_returns.default : strip_returns.default)

can often be replaced by a call to the function ask_line_translate().


The Concurrent Process
--- ---------- -------

Epsilon now supports a concurrent process under Windows NT as well as
Windows 95.  The process buffer is now syntax colored, so the
prompts, the input, and the output are each colored differently.

Epsilon now maintains a command history for the process buffer.  You
can now use Alt-P and Alt-N to retrieve the text of previous commands.

The <Enter> key in a concurrent process buffer now moves to the end
of a line before sending it.  The new process-enter-whole-line
variable controls this.

Under Windows 95, Epsilon can now send a Ctrl-C to 32-bit programs
running in its concurrent process buffer, though it still cannot send
input to them.  Under Windows NT, all input and output, and Ctrl-C, work
as expected.


File Associations and DDE
==== ============ === ===

You can now set up file associations for Epsilon using the
create-file-associations command.  It lets you modify a list of
common extensions, then sets up Windows to invoke Epsilon to edit
files with those extensions.  The files will be sent to an existing
copy of Epsilon, if one is running, via Epsilon's new DDE support.

A DDE execute message to Epsilon uses a subset of the syntax of
Epsilon's command line; it can contain file names to edit, the
+linenum flag, the flag -dVARNAME=VALUE to set an Epsilon variable,
-lFILENAME to load an EEL bytecode file, or -rFUNCNAME to run an EEL
function, command, or macro.  Epsilon uses a DDE server name of
"Epsilon" and a topic name of "Open".  In EEL, DDE messages arrive
via a special kind of WIN_DRAG_DROP event.

The new command line flag -add tells Epsilon for Windows to locate an
existing instance of Epsilon, pass it the rest of the command line
via DDE, and exit.  (Epsilon ignores the flag if there's no prior
instance.)  The new command line flag -nodde tells Epsilon for
Windows not to register itself as a DDE server or respond to DDE
messages.


C Mode Enhancements
- ---- ------------

By default, when you yank text in a buffer in C mode, Epsilon
automatically reindents it.  This is similar to the "smart paste"
feature in some other editors.  Set reindent-after-c-yank to zero to
disable this behavior.  Epsilon won't automatically reindent if the
text is very large, or isn't a whole line, or if you provide a
negative argument to the yank command.  Alt-<Minus> Ctrl-Y is one way
to yank without reindenting in C mode.

In C mode, the Alt-<Down> and Alt-<Up> keys move to the next or
previous #if/#else/#endif preprocessor line.  When starting from
such a line, Epsilon finds the next/previous matching one, skipping
over inner nested preprocessor lines.  Alt-] and Alt-[ do the same.

All delimiter-matching commands such as forward-level and
backward-level now understand and ignore delimiters inside comments
or strings, when appropriate, in C/C++ mode.

If you want the width of tab characters to be different in C mode
buffers than in other buffers, set c-tab-override to the desired
value.

The new merge-diff command is a variation on diff; it compares two C
mode buffers and produces a new buffer with differences marked off by
#ifdef lines.  Also see the new command visual-diff.

HTML Mode
==== ====

Epsilon now includes HTML mode.  Epsilon does syntax highlighting
(including embedded JavaScript) and brace-matching.  The commenting
commands work too.

Also see the description of the auto-show-html-delimiters variable.


Integrated EEL Compiler
---------- --- --------

The EEL compiler has been integrated into Epsilon, so you can enjoy
lightning-fast compiles via compile-buffer on Alt-F3.

Epsilon for Windows 95/NT includes an eval command that quickly
evaluates an arbitrary EEL expression.  Similarly, the execute-eel
command executes a line of EEL code that you type in.


Tags & Browser Support
---- - ------- -------

You can set tag_case_sensitive nonzero if you want tagging to
consider MAIN, Main and main to be distinct tags.  By default,
typing main will find any of these.

When there are several instances of a single tag, you can now use
Ctrl-<NumPlus> and Ctrl-<NumMinus> to move among them.
Ctrl-<NumStar> is now another way to jump back to the previous
location after following a tag, like Alt-j.

The tag system can now use .BSC files from Microsoft Visual C++
4.1/4.2/5.0.  Epsilon requires a Microsoft Browser Toolkit DLL to do
this.  We have not received permission to redistribute this DLL from
Microsoft, but you can download it from their web site at
<http://www.microsoft.com/kb/articles/q153/3/93.htm>, or from an MSDN
library disk (search for Knowledge Base article Q153393 or the older
Q94375).  If you use Visual 4.1 or 4.2, download the archive
BSCKIT41.EXE and extract the file bsc41.dll.  If you use Visual C
5.0, download the archive BSCKIT50.EXE and extract the file
msbsc50.dll.  With either DLL file, rename it to bsc.dll and place it
in the directory containing Epsilon's executable (for example,
c:\Program Files\Epsilon\Bin).  Then use the select-tag-file command
on Ctrl-X Alt-<Comma> to select your .BSC file.  (See Microsoft
compiler documentation for information on generating .BSC and .SBR
files.)


TeX Mode
=== ====

Epsilon now includes TeX mode.  For TeX, Epsilon provides features
similar to Herb Schulz's popular TeX mode user extension, plus syntax
highlighting and auto-show-delimiters.  (See the description of the
auto-show-tex-delimiters variable.)

Keys in TeX mode include Alt-i for italic text, Alt-Shift-I for
slanted text, Alt-Shift-T for typewriter, Alt-Shift-B for boldface,
Alt-Shift-F for a footnote, and Alt-s for a centered line.
Alt-Shift-E prompts for the name of a LaTeX environment, then inserts
\begin{env} and \end{env} lines for the one you select.  (The list of
environments comes from the file latex.env, which you can edit.)

For all these commands, you can highlight a block of text first and
Epsilon will make the text italic, slanted, etc. or you can use the
command and then type the text to be italic, slanted, etc.

The keys { and $ insert matched pairs of characters (either {} or
$$), the keys <Comma> and <Period> remove a preceding italic
correction \/, the " key inserts the appropriate kind of doublequote
sequence like `` or '', and the Alt-" inserts an actual " character.

Some TeX mode commands are slightly different in LaTeX than in pure
TeX.  Set tex-force-latex to 1 if all your documents are LaTeX, 0 if
all your documents are TeX, or 2 if Epsilon should determine this on
a document-by-document basis.  In that case, Epsilon will assume a
document is LaTeX if it contains a \begin{document} statement or if
it's in a file with an .ltx extension.


Display Changes
------- -------

Epsilon now does syntax highlighting in HTML, TeX, dired, grep, and
several other types of buffers.

The new visual-diff command is like diff but uses colors to show
differences.  Also see the new command merge-diff.

The commands menu-bar and scroll-bar, which toggle the menu bar and
scroll bar, respectively, have been renamed toggle-menu-bar and
toggle-scroll-bar.  (Epsilon for Windows does not yet recognize
toggle-scroll-bar.)

When the cursor is on a delimiter like ( or [ in C/C++, HTML, or TeX
modes, Epsilon now automatically highlights that delimiter and its
matching delimiter.  If the delimiter has no match, Epsilon does not
highlight.  You can set the variables auto-show-c-delimiters,
auto-show-html-delimiters, or auto-show-tex-delimiters to zero to
disable this feature.

By default Epsilon's VESA SVGA support for DOS is now disabled.  Set
the extra-video-modes variable to 3 to turn it back on.

Searching
---------

Replace commands now preserve case.  Epsilon examines the case of
each match.  If a match is entirely uppercase, or all words are
capitalized, Epsilon makes the replacement text entirely uppercase or
capitalized, as appropriate.  Epsilon only does this when searching
is case-insensitive, and neither the search string nor the replace
string contain uppercase letters.  For example, if you search for the
regular expression "welcome|hello" and replace it with "greetings",
Epsilon replaces HELLO with GREETINGS and Welcome with Greetings.

The searching commands that use special dialogs have been renamed:

Old name            New Name
find                dialog-search
reverse-find        dialog-reverse-search
replace-box         dialog-replace
regex-replace-box   dialog-regex-replace


DOS/OEM Character Set Support
======= ========= === =======

Windows programs typically use a different character set than do DOS
programs.  The DOS character set is known as the DOS/OEM character
set, and includes various line drawing characters and miscellaneous
characters not in the Windows/ANSI set.  The Windows/ANSI character
set includes many accented characters not in the DOS/OEM character
set.  Epsilon for Windows uses the Windows/ANSI character set (with
most fonts).

The oem-to-ansi command converts the current buffer from the DOS/OEM
character set to the Windows/ANSI character set.  The ansi-to-oem
command does the reverse.  If any character in the buffer doesn't
have a unique translation, these commands warn first, and move to the
first character without a unique translation.

The find-oem-file command reads a file using the DOS/OEM character
set, translating it into the Windows/ANSI character set, and arranges
things so when you save the file, the reverse translation
automatically occurs.  These commands are only available in Epsilon
for Windows.

Commands like forward-word that navigate by words now use the ANSI
character set to determine which characters represent letters.  This
change affects Epsilon for Windows only; other versions of Epsilon
still use the OEM character set for this purpose.


EEL Language Changes
--- -------- -------

The EEL language itself has been improved by the addition of
ANSI-C-style function declarations, and ANSI-C-style prototypes.
We've expanded the facility that lets you call DLL routines from EEL
to allow for passing pointers by reference.

The EEL compiler now understands ANSI-C-style declarations like

   int get_something(char *p, int size);

The EEL compiler now creates .b files in the current directory, not
the directory containing the source file.

Keyboard macros defined in command files can now use the syntax
<!find-file> to run a command without knowing which key it's bound
to.  For example, you can define a macro as (define-macro
"fill-buffer" "<!mark-whole-buffer><!fill-region>").  You can now use
a menu bar command or a command on the tool bar while defining a
macro, and it will be recorded (using the above syntax).


More Font Choices
---- ---- -------

You can now specify a specific font for use in printing with the
set-printer-font command.  Similarly, the set-dialog-font command
lets you specify what font to use for Epsilon's dialog windows (like
the one bufed displays).  There are also corresponding new variables
font-printer and font-dialog.

The new command change-font-size supplements set-font by providing
additional font choices.  Some Windows fonts include a variety of
character cell widths for a given character cell height.  (For
example, many of the font selections available in windowed DOS
sessions use multiple widths.)  Commands like set-font utilize the
standard Windows font dialog, which doesn't provide any way to select
these alternate widths.  The change-font-size command lets you choose
these fonts.

The change-font-size command doesn't change the font name, or toggle
bold or italic.  You'll need to use the set-font command to do that.

Instead, change-font-size lets you adjust the height and width of the
current font using the arrow keys.  You can abort to restore the old
font settings, or press <Enter> or <Space> to keep them.  This is a
handy way to shrink or expand the font size.  A width or height of 0
means use a suitable default.


Improved Color Selection
-------- ----- ---------

The set-color command now works in Epsilon for Windows.  A new
command export-colors constructs an EEL source file of color
settings based on the current color settings.

The list-all command no longer includes color settings.  To transfer
color settings to future versions, use the export-colors command, not
list-all.  (The new list-colors command makes a list of color
settings like list-all did in previous versions.)

The EEL syntax for defining colors has been extended slightly.  You
can now specify that a particular color class is the same as a
previously-defined color class, like this:

color_scheme "standard-gui" {
    color_class text black on white;
    color_class tex_text = color_class text;
};

Starting Epsilon
-------- -------

The preserve-session variable now understands new values.  Set it to
2 to save the session every time you exit, but not to restore the
session by default.  Set it to 4 to restore the session normally (see
the session-always-restore variable) but not to save the session.
The value 1 does both, as before, and the value 0 does neither.

The default value of the session-always-restore variable is now 1.
This means that Epsilon will restore its previous session even when
you invoke it with a file name on its command line, or double-click
on a file associated with Epsilon.  This variable no longer overrides
the preserve-session variable or the -p flag; it only sets whether
Epsilon behaves differently when started with a file name.

You can set the session-restore-files variable to control whether
Epsilon restores files named in a session file, or just search
strings, command history, and similar settings.  If
session-restore-files is 0, when Epsilon restores a session, it won't
load any files named in the session, only things like like previous
search strings.  If 1, the default, Epsilon will restore previous
files as well as other settings.  If 2, Epsilon will restore previous
files only if there were no files specified on Epsilon's command line.

When Epsilon looks for one of its files, it no longer looks in the
current directory first.  (Previously, Epsilon looked in the current
directory first, but the -w2 flag told it to skip this step.  Now
Epsilon acts as if this flag is always present.)  Epsilon now looks
for its files in the directory containing its executable, the parent
of that directory, and then in the directories named by the EPSPATH
configuration variable.  See EPSPATH in the manual for complete
details.

The new -w16 flag tells Epsilon to set its current directory to the
directory containing the first file named on its command line.  If
you edit files by dragging them to a shortcut to Epsilon, you may
wish to use this flag in the shortcut.

Miscellaneous
-------------

Epsilon for Windows 95/NT now supports the Microsoft IntelliMouse.
You can roll the wheel to scroll the current window.  Or click the
wheel and drag the mouse to pan/auto-scroll--the speed and direction
of scrolling varies as you move the mouse.  The latter operation
works with any three-button mouse, under any version of Epsilon; it
does not require a wheeled mouse.

At most prompts Alt-E will retrieve your last response.  It's a
faster alternative to displaying the prompt history with <Up> or
Alt-<Up>, selecting the last item, and then pressing Alt-E to edit it.

The cd command now provides the current buffer's directory as a
previous response.  F7 Alt-E <Enter> is a quick way to change to the
current buffer's directory.

When a file changes on disk, Epsilon can automatically read the new
version.  (It doesn't do this if you've modified the copy in memory,
or the file on disk is substantially smaller than the copy in
memory.)  Set the auto-read-changed-file variable nonzero to enable
this behavior.  The dialog that displays when a file has been
modified has a new option to set this variable.

Epsilon now only creates a .bak file the first time it saves a file
in each session (if you've set want-backups to 1).  Set want-backups
to 2 if you want Epsilon to back up a file on every save.

The kill-current-buffer command is now bound to Ctrl-X Ctrl-K.  The
new kill-all-buffers command discards all user buffers.

With a numeric argument, the paragraph-filling commands now unwrap
lines in a paragraph, removing all line breaks.  Alt-2 Alt-Q is one
quick way to unwrap the current paragraph.

In previous versions, you couldn't use Shift-<ArrowKey> to select
text in a keyboard macro.  This and some related problems have been
fixed.

Pressing <Tab> or Backtab (Shift-<Tab>) with a highlighted region now
indents or unindents the region using indent-rigidly.

The profile command now works in Epsilon for Windows 95/NT.

New Primitives
--- ----------

memset(char *ptr, char value, int count)

The memset() primitive sets all the count characters in a character
array ptr to the given value.

windows_set_font(char *title, b16 fnt_code)

The windows_set_font() primitive now takes two parameters.  Title
specifies the title of the dialog box to display.  The fnt_code says
whether to set Epsilon's main font (FNT_SCREEN), the font for
printing (FNT_PRINTER), or the font for Epsilon's dialogs
(FNT_DIALOG).

int comm_dlg_color(int oldcolor, char *title)

In Epsilon for Windows, the comm_dlg_color() primitive lets the user
select a color using the Windows common color dialog.  The oldcolor
parameter specifies the default color, and title specifies the
dialog's title.  The primitive returns the selected color, or -1 if
the user canceled.

display_dialog_box(char *dialogname, char *title,
                   int win1, int win2, int win3,
                   char *button1, char *button2, char *button3)

The display_dialog_box() primitive now takes three window handles,
and can create dialogs with up to three windows.  Some new
dialognames have been defined:

Name			Windows
ASKEXITBOX		2
HELPSETUP1		1
SETCOLORBOX		3


int eel_compile(char *file, int use_fsys, char *flags,
                char *errors, int just_check)

The eel_compile primitive lets Epsilon for Windows NT/95 run the EEL
compiler via a DLL, without having to invoke a command processor.
File specifies the name of a file or buffer.  If use_fsys is nonzero,
it names a file; if use_fsys is zero, a buffer.  The flags parameter
may contain any desired command line flags.  Compiler messages will
go to the buffer named errors.  Unless errors occur or the just_check
parameter is nonzero, Epsilon will automatically load the result of
the compilation.  No bytecode file on disk will be modified.  Note
that when the compiler includes header files, it will always read
them from disk, even if they happen to be in an Epsilon buffer.

char *make_pointer(int value)

The make_pointer() primitive can be useful when interacting with
system DLL's.  It takes a machine address as a number, and returns an
EEL pointer that may be used to access memory at that address.  No
error checking will be done on the validity of the pointer.

int mouse_panning;
int mouse_panning_rate(int percent, int slow, int fast)

The mouse_panning variable and the mouse_panning_rate() primitive
work together to support panning and auto-scroll with the Microsoft
IntelliMouse (or any other three button mouse).  The EEL subroutine
that receives clicks of the third mouse button sets mouse_panning
nonzero to tell Epsilon to begin panning and record the initial
position of the mouse.

Then the subroutine can regularly call mouse_panning_rate() to
determine how quickly, and in what direction, to scroll.  The
parameter percent specifies the percentage of the screen the mouse
has to travel to reach maximum speed (usually 40%).  The parameter
slow specifies the minimum speed in milliseconds per screen line
(usually 2000 ms/line).  The parameter fast specifies the maximum
speed in milliseconds per screen line (usually 1 ms/line).

The mouse_panning_rate() primitive uses these figures, plus the
current position of the mouse, to return the scroll rate in
milliseconds per screen line.  It returns a positive number if
Epsilon should scroll down, a negative number to scroll up, or zero
if Epsilon should not scroll.

int is_remote_file(char *fname)

The is_remote_file() primitive tells whether fname looks like a valid
URL.  It returns 1 if fname starts with a service name like ftp://,
http://, or telnet://, or 2 if fname appears to be an Emacs-style
remote file name like /hostname:filename.

call_dll(dll_name, func_name, ftype, args, ...)
    char *dll_name, *func_name, *ftype, *args;

The call_dll() primitive can now unload a DLL.  Call it with just the
DLL name, omitting any function name or other parameters, to do this.

A new parameter-type letter can appear in the ftype parameter.  R
indicates that a DLL function returns a pointer by reference; Epsilon
will pass the pointer you supply (if any) and retrieve the result.
Use this for DLL functions that require a pointer to a pointer, and
pass the address of any EEL variable whose type is "pointer to ..."
(other than "pointer to function").

user buffer int type_point;

The type_point variable is now buffer-specific.  Internet commands
for Telnet and FTP use type_point much like the process buffer does,
to determine where to insert text into a buffer and where to read any
text to be sent.

copy_buffer_variables(int tobuf, int frombuf)

The copy_buffer_variables() primitive sets all buffer-specific
variables in the buffer tobuf to their values in the buffer frombuf.
If frombuf is zero, Epsilon resets all buffer-specific variables in
the buffer tobuf to their default values.

EEL Subroutine Changes
--- ---------- -------

The meaning of the FOLD and MODFOLD bits in searching flags is now
slightly different.  Now MODFOLD means to use a specific case-fold
setting, not the default setting for the buffer, and FOLD indicates
the specific case-fold setting.  When MODFOLD is zero, searching
functions use the default setting for the buffer.  When MODFOLD is
nonzero, searching functions case-fold if and only if FOLD is nonzero.


File Name Case
---- ---- ----

When retrieving file names from some file systems, Epsilon
automatically translates the file names to lowercase.  Epsilon now
uses different rules for determining when to convert retrieved file
names to lowercase, and when two file names that differ only by case
refer to the same file.

Epsilon distinguishes between three types of file systems:

On a case-sensitive file system, MyFile, MYFILE, and myfile refer to
three different files.  Unix file systems are case-sensitive.

On a case-preserving (but not case-sensitive) file system, MyFile,
MYFILE, and myfile all refer to the same file.  But if you create a
file as MyFile, the file system will display that file as MyFile
without altering its case.  VFAT, NTFS, and HPFS file systems used in
Windows 95, Windows NT, and OS/2 are case-preserving.

On a non-case-preserving file system, MyFile, MYFILE, and myfile all
refer to the same file.  Moreover, the operating system converts all
file names to upper case.  So no matter how you create the file, the
operating system always shows it as MYFILE.  DOS's FAT file system is
non-case-preserving.  When Epsilon displays a file name from such a
file system, it changes the file name to all-lowercase.

Epsilon asks the operating system for information on each drive, the
first time the drive is accessed.  (Actually only Epsilon for Windows
95/NT and Epsilon for OS/2 can do this; Epsilon for Windows 3.1
assumes that all drives are non-case-preserving.  Epsilon for DOS
asks the operating system when it runs under Windows 95; in other
environments it assumes drives are non-case-preserving.)


You can tell Epsilon to use particular rules for each drive on your
system by defining an environment variable.  The MIXEDCASEDRIVES
environment variable should contain a list of drive letters or
ranges.  If the variable exists and a lowercase letter like k appears
in it, Epsilon assumes drive K: has a Unix-style case-sensitive file
system.  If the variable exists and an uppercase letter like J
appears in it, Epsilon assumes drive J: is not case-preserving or
case-sensitive, like traditional FAT drives.  If the variable exists
but a drive letter does not appear in it, Epsilon assumes the drive
has a case-preserving but not case-sensitive file system like NTFS,
HPFS, or VFAT drives.

If, for example, drives h:, i:, j:, and p: access Unix filesystems
over a network, drive q: accesses a server that uses a FAT
filesystem, and other drives use a VFAT filesystem (local drives
under NT or 95, for example), you could set MIXEDCASEDRIVES to h-jpQ.
When Epsilon finds a MIXEDCASEDRIVES variable, it assumes the
variable contains a complete list of such drives, and doesn't examine
filesystems as described.  If an EPSMIXEDCASEDRIVES configuration
variable exists, that overrides any MIXEDCASEDRIVES environment
variable that may be found.  (Note that MIXEDCASEDRIVES appears in
the environment under all operating systems, while EPSMIXEDCASEDRIVES
must be put in lugeps.ini, in the registry, or in the environment,
depending on the operating system.  See "configuration variables" in
the manual for details.)

When Epsilon retrieves an all-uppercase file name from a
non-case-sensitive file system, it normally shows the name in
lowercase.  Set the variable preserve-filename-case nonzero if you
want Epsilon to show file names exactly as the operating system
reports them.


An EEL program can use the filename_rules() primitive to determine
the rules Epsilon is using for a particular file system.  It takes
any legal file name and returns a code whose values are represented
by macros defined in codes.h.

The FSYS_CASE_IGNORED code indicates a non-case-preserving file
system like DOS.  The FSYS_CASE_PRESERVED code indicates a
case-preserving file system like NTFS or VFAT.  The
FSYS_CASE_SENSITIVE code indicates a case-sensitive file system like
Unix.  The FSYS_CASE_UNKNOWN code indicates that Epsilon couldn't
determine anything about the file system.  The function also returns
a bit flag FSYS_SHORT_NAMES, valid whenever any code but
FSYS_CASE_UNKNOWN is returned, that indicates whether only 8+3 names
are supported.
