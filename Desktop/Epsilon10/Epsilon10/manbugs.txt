This file lists all known errors in the revision 9A manual for
Epsilon 9.0.  All these errors have been corrected in the online
documentation.  This file doesn't mention online documentation
revisions that describes new or changed features: see the readme file
for that.


The description of the tex-look-back variable was omitted from the
printed manual.

One section of the manual suggested pressing <Tab> to edit the
current line when viewing a history or completion list.  This only
works in Epsilon for DOS or OS/2.  The Alt-E key works in all
environments.

The descriptions of the c-mode-mouse-to-tag and mouse-goes-to-tag
variables didn't make it clear that they applied to Epsilon for DOS
and Epsilon for OS/2, not Epsilon for Windows.

The OS/2 variation of the -ka flag was omitted from the printed
manual.

The description of the select-help-files command now refers to the
winhelp-display-contents variable.

The description of the tex-environment command now mentions the
latex.env file.

The description of the tex-left-brace command was corrected.

When the beep-frequency variable is zero, Epsilon for DOS or OS/2
actually flashes the mode lines of each window, not the entire screen.

The documentation for the clipboard-access variable describes how
killing and yanking commands avoid automatically accessing the
Windows clipboard when run from a keyboard macro.  The documentation
for the yank command now describes auto-indenting and clipboard
access.

The description of the OS/2 version of the do_interrupt() primitive
didn't explain how the return value when calling 32-bit functions
could be retrieved.

The description of the get_strnone() subroutine was corrected.

The when_idle() subroutine's return value is actually in hundredths
of a second, not milliseconds.
